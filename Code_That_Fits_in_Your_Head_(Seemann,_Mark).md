#### Code That Fits in Your Head (Seemann, Mark)
      As the science-fiction author William Gibson said: “The future is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed”9

      Checklists come in two forms: read-do and do-confirm [40]. With a read-do checklist, you read each item on the list and immediately perform the action before you move on to the next item.

      You may know Test Doubles as mocks and stubs. Like the word unit test, there’s no consensus about what these words actually mean. I try to avoid them for that reason.

      Write code for readers. As Martin Fowler put it: “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” [34]

      As Kent Beck puts it: “for each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change” [6]
