#### SYSTEMANTICS. THE SYSTEMS BIBLE (Gall, John)
      basic task ofprotecting us from too much awareness, we see what we had hitherto failed to notice: that malfunction is the rule and flawless operation the exception.

      SYSTEMS OPERATE BY REDISTRIBUTING ANERGY INTO DIFFERENT FORMS AND INTO ACCUMULATIONS OF DIFFERENT SIZES

      COMPLEX SYSTEMS EXHIBIT UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR

      LARGE SYSTEM, PRODUCED BY EXPANDING THE DIMENSIONS OF A SMALLER SYSTEM, DOES NOT BEHAVE LIKE THE SMALLER SYSTEm

      SYSTEMS TEND TO MALFUNCTION CONSPICUOUSLY JUST AFTER THEIR GREATEST TRIUMPH

      PEOPLE IN SYSTEMS DO NOT DO WHAT THE SYSTEM SAYS THEY ARE DOING

      THE BIGGER THE SYSTEM, THE NARROWER AND MORE SPECIALIZED THE INTERFACE WITH INDIVIDUALS

      DESIGNERS OF SYSTEMS TEND TO DESIGN WAYS FOR THEMSELVES TO BYPASS THE SYSTEM

      ANY SYSTEM CAN BE EXPLOITED

      BIG SYSTEMS EITHER WORK ON THEIR OWN OR THEY DON’T. IF THEY DON’T, YOU CAN’T MAKE THEM

      EVEN TRYING TO BE HELPFUL IS A DELICATE AND DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING

      ADDING MANPOWER TO A LATE SOFTWARE PROJECT MAKES IT LATER

      COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT WORKS IS INVARIABLY FOUND TO HAVE EVOLVED FROM A SIMPLE SYSTEM THAT WORKED

      IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS, MALFUNCTION AND EVEN TOTAL NON-FUNCTION MAY NOT BE DETECTABLE FOR LONG PERIODS, IF EVER

      ANY LARGE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE OPERATING MOST OF THE TIME IN FAILURE MODE

      How does it work when its components aren’t working well? How does it fail? How well does it work in Failure Mode?

      WHEN A FAIL-SAFE SYSTEM FAILS, IT FAILS BY FAILING TO FAIL SAFE

      Yes, Virginia, your programwillcontain Bugs. And they will surprise you when you find them.

      IF IT DOESN’T FAIL HERE, IT WILL FAIL THERE

      ERROR CORRECTION IS WHAT WE DO

      AS SYSTEMS GROW IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THEY TEND TO LOSE BASIC FUNCTIONS 71

      COLOSSAL ERRORS TEND TO ESCAPE NOTICE

      Military Systems-person reported from Vietnam, “We had to destroy the village in order to save it,”

      TOTAL SYSTEM THAT GOES INTO A RUNAWAY SEQUENCE MAY BE FORCED TO GROW OR TO DISINTEGRATE IN CHAOS

      IN SETTING UP A NEW SYSTEM, TREAD SOFTLY. YOU MAY BE DISTURBING ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING 79

      THE MESSAGE SENT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MESSAGE RECEIVED

      THE MEANING OF A COMMUNICATION IS THE BEHAVIOR THAT RESULTS

      THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU WANT. THE INFORMATION YOU WANT IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU NEED. THE INFORMATION YOU NEED IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU CAN OBTAIN.

      IF YOU’RE NOT THERE, THE ACCIDENT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT YOU

      DESTINY IS LARGELY A SET OF UNQUESTIONED ASSUMPTIONS

      SOMETHING ISN’T WORKING, DON’T KEEP DOING IT. DO SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD

      FOR MAXIMUM SUCCESS, FEEL FREE TO SWITCH SYSTEMS AND EVEN TO SWITCH GOALS

      New Problems are created by its very presence.[a.] Once set up, it won’t Go Away; it Grows and Encroaches.[b.] It begins to do Strange and Wonderful Things[c.] and Breaks Down in Ways You Never Thought Possible.[d.] It Kicks Back, Gets In The Way and Opposes Its Own Proper Function.[e.] Your own perspective becomes distorted by being In The System.[f.] You become anxious and Push On It To Make It Work.

      The Public School System, on the other hand, although founded with the highest and most altruistic goals in mind, remains in a state of chronic failure because it violates the principle of spontaneity in human learning.

      BAD DESIGN CAN RARELY BE OVERCOME BY MORE DESIGN, WHETHER GOOD OR BAD

      Corporate Mergers represent a special case, analogous in some aspects to the welding together of two, three or more ships of differing size, purpose, and speed, and attempting to navigate the resulting product.[cvi] We confine ourselves to our earlier observation that

      WHEN EVERYTHING CORRELATES WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, THINGS WILL NEVER SETTLE DOWN

      THE FUTURE IS NO MORE PREDICTABLE NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE PAST, BUT YOU CAN AT LEAST TAKE NOTE OF TRENDS

      Catalytic Managership will only work if the System is so designed that something can actually happen—a condition that commonly is not met.

      •The molecular structure of the gene—closest thing to the true “secret of life”—was revealed through X-ray crystallography, a technique having little to do with biology. And  James Watson, who solved the puzzle, was not an X-ray crystallographer. He was not even a chemist. Furthermore, he had been refused a renewal of his research grant because his sponsors felt he wasn’t sticking to the point.

      GREAT ADVANCES DO NOT COME OUT OF SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE GREAT ADVANCES

      Pragmatically, it is generally easier to aim at changing one or a few things at a time and then work out the unexpected effects, than to go to the opposite extreme. Attempting to correct everything in one grand design is appropriately designated as Grandiosity.

      IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW HOW TO AVOID THE MOST LIKELY WAYS TO FAIL

      IF IT PUTS A WEAPON IN YOUR HAND, IT IS AIMING AT SOME KIND OF VIOLENCE

      ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE, AN INTERVENTION MUST INTRODUCE A CHANGE AT THE CORRECT LOGICAL LEVEL[cxxvi

      We cannot know all the potential behaviors of the System.

      PRIMATE PEEPER PEEPS, SEES PRIMATE PEEPING AT PRIMATE PEEPER

      IF THINGS SEEM TO BE GETTING WORSE EVEN FASTER THAN USUAL, CONSIDER THAT THE REMEDY MAY BE AT FAULT

      more succinctly: STAY OUT OF THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK TRAP

      THINGS ARE ACTING VERY STRANGELY, CONSIDER THAT YOU MAY BE IN A FEEDBACK SITUATION

      IF YOU CAN’T CHANGE THE SYSTEM, CHANGE THE FRAME—IT COMES TO THE SAME THING

      IN ORDER TO REMAIN UNCHANGED, THE SYSTEM MUST CHANGE

#### Hoaxed: Everything They Told You is a Lie (Cernovich, Mike)
      "To get more out of life, you must get more out of yourself. You must take personal responsibility for your thoughts and emotions. You must stop blaming the system. Your days of looking outside of yourself for answers are gone."

      But as a viewer and listener, be cautious. Most audio is clipped for a reason, and that's because there is other context that would explain it.

      Walter Duranty of The New York Times won a Pulitizer Prize for his reporting on Stalin. According to Duranty, no one in the Ukraine or Soviet Union were starving. Reports about famines were fake news.

      To understand the media requires you to set aside logic and reasoning. Embrace the double standard.

      You'll have some stories for life that you can never tell, and besides, no one would believe those stories.

      Most people go into politics because they couldn't make it in business, cut it as a real writer, or invent anything in tech. Why do you think tech journalists are nasty? When you have an IQ of 115, the Dunning–Kruger effect kicks in. You're smart enough to think you understand a company like Uber, but you'd never have had the vision, aggression, or focus to start such a company.

      libertarians who hate Neo-Cons, who hate Paleo-Cons, who hate Anarcho-Capitalists, who hate Hotep, you know, who hate the alt-light, [who] hate the alt-right, [who] hate the new right. There’s-, there’s a whole cornucopia of people out here. The

      And so, the problem is if the media is hypocritical, the response is not to respond to hypocrisy with more hypocrisy.

      And so, this idea of fake news is sort of a misnomer. Because fake news creates real opinions, which creates real actions.

      But they're able to change the rights of people based on the identities that they ascribe to them.

      have an infinite faith in the power of free people to make the correct policy decisions if they're given the facts.

      That's probably the greatest problem in our society: People don't-, people don't really want to see and know what's true. They don't. They want to live in a fantasy world.

      Infowars’ greatest accomplish is simply pointing out that there is a worldwide corporate government being set up that is tax exempt and has diplomatic immunity.

      Okay, let's talk about the left-wing bias in the mainstream media — because I am a liberal. I'm a registered Democrat. I have always been my entire adult life. And it wasn't until I became the subject of a smear campaign that I started to see through the liberal bias of the mainstream media. And now I see it everywhere. Everywhere! I mean, it's not just the news. It's the TV shows you watch and it's commercials and it's everywhere. It's the music videos that are being put out...it's the VMA Awards...it's everywhere. It's not just news television shows.

      free.” They say “unregulated” when they mean “free.” And it very much went against the wisdom of the time to say that a centrally planned economy cannot possibly work. It doesn't matter the intentions. It doesn't matter the virtues. It doesn't matter the processes or procedures that go in place. You simply can't make it work.

      They keep losing the argument — ideologically, empirically, factually. They keep losing the argument, but they won't let go of the ideology. And so they have no choice but to escalate.

      And it's-, of course! To expect non-hypocrisy from most people in the intellectual realm is a fantasy. In my particular-, I can’t prove this, but I think there's strong reasonable arguments behind it: Language, philosophy, ethics, universality was invented by and for hypocrisy. Because if I can create a moral rule that says, “Don't use violence,” and then except myself from that moral rule, I have disarmed you, and I'm now elevated and powerful. If I go into a boxing ring, and I've convinced the guy verbally to not fight back very hard — or not fight back at all — but, look at that!: World Champion.

      Hypocrisy is why universals and ethics are invented, and the fact that the left uses it merely confirms that thesis.

      So, people don't listen to reason and evidence. The question is, then: “How do they change their minds?” And the sad truth is that they change their minds based on how certain you are. They can't judge your ideas. They can only judge how you judge your ideas. And if you are all-in, and you are certain, and you are

      The studies are very clear: It doesn't doesn't change people's minds at all. In fact, when somebody has a fixed belief, and you give them opposing reason and evidence as factual, it hardens their belief. It reinforces their error. You're actually making your enemy stronger by bringing reason and evidence to a sophistry fight.

      “I'm not going to let giant political decisions, involving billions or trillions of dollars and essential human freedoms, to be driven by pianos and sad eyes,”

      Piano is not an argument. People being sad is not an argument.

      There is no long-term future for fiat currency. There never has been, in the entire history of the world. All fiat currencies fail. The longest it's ever lasted is the British pound sterling — about 400 years. But it's lost ninety-eight percent of its value over that time. There is no long-term future for fiat currencies. And the future is in whatever can't be manufactured

      By God, I hope the future of news are facts. I hope that the future of news is illumination.

      This is what Gaddafi said very clearly: “You take me down — I am the barrier between Africa and Europe — you take me down, and you will have floods of migrants.”

      don't blame the migrants. It is a perfectly rational resource acquisition strategy to spend a couple of thousand bucks or a couple of hundred bucks, or however much it costs, for various people to get in.

      And there was this massive panic. And DDT was banned around the world. Now some very credible scholarship has been poured into this to try and figure out what has been the fallout of this ban. And some fairly conservative estimates put the death count that resulted from the increases in malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases that came out of this DDT ban — because if you didn't have the DDT, you got a whole lot more mosquitoes — at about 60 million people. About 60 million people have died as a result of this DDT hysteria.

      I mean, it's a moving target. Doesn't matter. They just hate the free market. Because they can't compete in the free market. Because their sophists. And they're manipulators. And the one thing that is very true, in my experience, of people on the left: Nothing spells, “rational pragmatism,” like working with your hands once in your goddamn life. Work with your hands. Do you know how dangerous it has been? People don't grow their own food anymore. Try having a tantrum because your watermelon didn't grow. Try screaming at your tomato plants. “More tomatoes! I need them!” But, you can scream at the government. You can scream at guilty people and they'll give you resources so you'll shut up and go away. Try screaming at a cow — she'll just shit on your hand rather than give you milk.

      been so relentlessly just proven wrong time and again, they have to reject reality. But they don't want to reject the consequences of rejecting reality. Which is: They should shut the hell up about truth and virtue and goodness and rightness, and they should stop complaining about other people who have different moral perspectives from theirs, because they don't even really believe those people exist. So why would you bother? I don't spend a lot of time lecturing puppets because puppets don't exist as conscious entities.

      You participate in the technological society and you, by participating in it, you indicate your assent to the ontological presuppositions and the epistemological presuppositions upon which it's based. And you might say, “Well, no I don't.” And I would say, “Well, who cares what you say?” I'm going to watch how you act as a better indicator of your fundamental truth, and there's no reason to assume whatsoever that what you say and what you do are in alignment, like, they might be, but often with people they’re not in alignment at all.

      “But, no, I really have a tremendous amount of hatred and I'm going to take it out on anyone who's foreign.” Now, that's sort of typical of that-, of the Nazi-type ultranationalists. And then, on the left, it's like, “Well, I like the poor and the oppressed and I stand for them.” It's like, “Well, no, you're just resentful and jealous and-, and you don't believe that hard work matters, because you don't work hard and you don't plan to, and so, you can place a mask of virtue over your miserable, destructive resentment and then you can tolerate looking at yourself in the mirror.” And so, I mean, this is why I'm no fan of ideologies, generally speaking, because they have exactly that property.

      when you act out a falsehood, then something terrible happens. That's the definition of a falsehood, fundamentally.

      Now, so, imagine that your belief systems are essentially maps of the world, so, they're maps that you use to orient yourself with, because we move from point to point, right? We're active creatures and then those maps are very complexly structured — they're sort of hierarchically structured. And so, for example, you have some assumptions that are predicates of more of your actions than others.

      And so, the prestige is related to the power of the-, of the institution to change perception and behavior. Well, so it's-, it's-, it's the brand, so you could say the brand is the marker of that prestige that’s being stored up across time. Yeah.

      Like, you know, I can put up a YouTube video that I make in a day, and it'll have fifteen thousand views in a week. I can't do that with a book. That would take me three years and probably it wouldn’t happen. I probably wouldn't sell fifteen thousand copies. So, it's a whole new thing and it's-, God only knows how powerful it is. You know, we have no idea. It’s a Gutenberg Revolution for the spoken word.

      Nietzsche thought, well, human beings would have to become supermen, in some sense, in order to overcome the death of God. To bear it. And that they could do that, in some sense, by voluntarily recreating themselves.

      It's completely unlikely, but these old ideas, man, they're-, they're eternal. That's what they are. And you become dissociated from them at your extreme peril, psychologically and socially. So...

      How could it be otherwise than that which you should aim for is the highest good that you could conceive of?

      And so, we can't lose that, because the alternative...like, you think, “Well, what's worse?” Is there anything worse than voluntarily accepting your own crucifixion, so to speak? Yeah! Running from it!

      But there's no pain-free way out. So, you’re either going to act nobly in the face of that and try to make things better, or you’re going to act in a cowardly, deceitful and resentful fashion, and make everything worse.

      You know, we think people have meaningless lives because they've abandoned God and they're nihilistic and, isn't that a catastrophe for them? It's like, yeah, it's a catastrophe. But it's not clear to me that it's more difficult than the alternative, which is to think, “Oh, you're actually responsible for your decisions, and they’re decisions between good and evil, and your decisions tilt the world towards Heaven or Hell in a very real way.” Directly, it's on you. It's like, who wants to believe that? That's meaning. That's meaning. You want meaning? That's meaning. It's like, no, man! I’ll take the nihilism. And the despair. It’s easier.

      totalitarian states would not have been possible without the moral corruption of the individuals within that society.

      let's say, then your suffering is just fine, because you haven't learned your lesson yet.

      even though I'm a libertarian — which is not really right-wing, because I don't care who marries who, and I don't have a right-wing orthodoxy, I'm more of a Libertarian

      “If you're wrong on the facts, hit the other side in an ad hominem sort of a way to deconstruct the opposing side to the jury. If you disfigure and get the jury to hate that person — even if they're right — the jury will side with you.” So

      Learn how to be resilient. Learn how to fight back. And remember what your grandmother told you: What other people think of you is none of your business.

      fascism is that you have to distort the truth, right? If you read Joe Goebbels’-, Joseph Goebbels' biography: The bigger the lie, the more impact and the more believable it will be. And so, that's coming from the left. Now, the left will be super mad at me for saying that. But that's actually the truth.

      And if we don't reset the country and reset the social contract, we run the risk of — and, again, am I talking about a revolution — but we run the risk of turning the country into something different than what it was that we grew up in. I grew up in the opportunistic-, I grew up in the aspirational working class. The working class today is desperate. And so, the reason I'm doing it is I want to really help that, because the country's been so good to me.

      for people that are watching this documentary. Nobody is the way they are actually portrayed in the media. Everybody is very, very different.

      know, Steve Jobs — took a Glock and capped the iPod. “Why'd ya kill the iPod, Steve?” “Well, someone was going to kill it — it might as well have been me.”

      People forget today — I'll make this statement, because I was there. People forget today how disorganized and how entrepreneurially lunatic-oriented we were inside that campaign. And so, it just wasn't that kind of campaign.

      But Beren laughed. ‘For little price,’ he said, ‘do Elven-kings sell their daughters: for gems, and things made by craft. But if this be your will, Thingol, I will perform it. And when we meet again my hand shall hold a Silmaril from the Iron Crown; for you have not looked the last upon Beren son of Barahir.’

#### The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Kuhn, Thomas S.)
      Hypotheses can count as “scientific” only if they are falsifiable. This purist vision of science would have been unthinkable before the great turn-of-the-century revolutions.

      Normal science does not aim at novelty but at clearing up the status quo.

      Discovery comes not when something goes right but when something is awry, a novelty

      There are always discrepancies between theory and data, many of them large.

      Theories should be accurate in their predictions, consistent, broad in scope, present phenomena in an orderly and coherent way, and be fruitful in suggesting new phenomena or relationships between phenomena.

      “paradigms.” These I take to be universally recognized scientific achievements that for a time provide model problems and solutions to a community of practitioners. Once that piece of my puzzle fell into place, a draft of this essay emerged rapidly.

      -of-date theories are not in principle unscientific because they have been discarded.

      Observation and experience can and must drastically restrict the range of admissible scientific belief, else there would be no science. But they cannot alone determine a particular body of such belief. An apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident, is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientific community at a given time.

      Much of the success of the enterprise derives from the community’s willingness to defend that assumption, if necessary at considerable cost. Normal science, for example, often suppresses fundamental novelties because they are necessarily subversive of its basic commitments.

      Nor are new inventions of theory the only scientific events that have revolutionary impact upon the specialists in whose domain they occur. The commitments that govern normal science specify not only what sorts of entities the universe does contain, but also, by implication, those that it does not.

      Scientific fact and theory are not categorically separable, except perhaps within a single tradition of normal-scientific practice. That is why the unexpected discovery is not simply factual in its import and why the scientist’s world is qualitatively transformed as well as quantitatively enriched by fundamental novelties of either fact or theory.

      How could history of science fail to be a source of phenomena to which theories about knowledge may legitimately be asked to apply?

      this essay, ‘normal science’ means research firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements, achievements that some particular scientific community acknowledges for a time as supplying the foundation for its further practice.

      Their achievement was sufficiently unprecedented to attract an enduring group of adherents away from competing modes of scientific activity. Simultaneously, it was sufficiently open-ended to leave all sorts of problems for the redefined group of practitioners to resolve.

      To be accepted as a paradigm, a theory must seem better than its competitors, but it need not, and in fact never does, explain all the facts with which it can be confronted.

      “Truth emerges more readily from error than from confusion.”10

      Nor do scientists normally aim to invent new theories, and they are often intolerant of those invented by others.

      By focusing attention upon a small range of relatively esoteric problems, the paradigm forces scientists to investigate some part of nature in a detail and depth that would otherwise be unimaginable.

      second usual but smaller class of factual determinations is directed to those facts that, though often without much intrinsic interest, can be compared directly with predictions from the paradigm theory.

      A third class of experiments and observations exhausts, I think, the fact-gathering activities of normal science. It consists of empirical work undertaken to articulate the paradigm theory, resolving some of its residual ambiguities and permitting the solution of problems to which it had previously only drawn attention

      many sciences, most normal work is of this sort. These three classes of problems—determination of significant fact, matching of facts with theory, and articulation of theory—exhaust, I think, the literature of normal science, both empirical and theoretical.

      The scientific enterprise as a whole does from time to time prove useful, open up new territory, display order, and test long-accepted belief. Nevertheless, the individual engaged on a normal research problem is almost never doing any one of these things. Once engaged, his motivation is of a rather different sort.

      Rules, I suggest, derive from paradigms, but paradigms can guide research even in the absence of rules.

      Scientists can agree that a Newton, Lavoisier, Maxwell, or Einstein has produced an apparently permanent solution to a group of outstanding problems and still disagree, sometimes without being aware of it, about the particular abstract characteristics that make those solutions permanent.

      Paradigms may be prior to, more binding, and more complete than any set of rules for research that could be unequivocally abstracted from them.

      recognition that his screen glowed when it should not. In both cases the perception of anomaly—of a phenomenon, that is, for which his paradigm had not readied the investigator—played an essential role in preparing the way for perception of novelty. But,

      But it does mean—what will ultimately be a central point—that the act of judgment that leads scientists to reject a previously accepted theory is always based upon more than a comparison of that theory with the world. The decision to reject one paradigm is always simultaneously the decision to accept another, and the judgment leading to that decision involves the comparison of both paradigms with nature and with each other.

      Copernicus complained that in his day astronomers were so “inconsistent in these [astronomical] investigations . . . that they cannot even explain or observe the constant length of the seasonal year.” “With them,” he continued, “it is as though an artist were to gather the hands, feet, head and other members for his images from diverse models, each part excellently drawn, but not related to a single body, and since they in no way match each other, the result would be monster rather than man.”

      Though an out-of-date theory can always be viewed as a special case of its up-to-date successor, it must be transformed for the purpose. And the transformation is one that can be undertaken only with the advantages of hindsight, the explicit guidance of the more recent theory.

      to make sense of statements that at least resemble these. What occurs during a scientific revolution is not fully reducible to a reinterpretation of individual and stable data.

      “A science that hesitates to forget its founders is lost.”

      Because they aim quickly to acquaint the student with what the contemporary scientific community thinks it knows, textbooks treat the various experiments, concepts, laws, and theories of the current normal science as separately and as nearly seriatim as possible.

      Darwin, in a particularly perceptive passage at the end of his Origin of Species, wrote: “Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume . . . , I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. . . . [B]ut I look with confidence to the future,—to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality.”

      Planck, surveying his own career in his Scientific Autobiography, sadly remarked that “a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”8

      and began to learn again from primitive models did the cleavage

      plan that had been present from the start.4 For many men the abolition of that teleological kind of evolution was the most significant and least palatable of Darwin’s suggestions.5 The Origin of Species recognized no goal set either by God or nature. Instead, natural selection, operating in the given environment and with the actual organisms presently at hand, was responsible for the gradual but steady emergence of more elaborate, further articulated, and vastly more specialized organisms.

      Cały ten proces oparto na głównej idei: znaczenie jest pochodną zależności między parami różnych rzeczy (między słowami języka, pikselami obrazu itd.), a zależności te można opisać przy użyciu funkcji odległości

      Bardziej adekwatna nazwa tej techniki uczenia maszynowego mogłaby mieć formę: warstwowe uczenie reprezentacji, hierarchiczne uczenie reprezentacji, a nawet modele głęboko różniczkowalne lub łańcuchy przekształceń geometrycznych (ta nazwa podkreślałaby to, że najważniejszym elementem uczenia maszynowego jest ciągła przestrzeń przekształceń geometrycznych).

      Powinieneś znać trzy typy sieci: sieci gęstych połączeń, sieci konwolucyjne i sieci rekurencyjne.

      Jedynym prawdziwym niebezpieczeństwem związanym ze współczesną sztuczną inteligencją jest błędne zinterpretowanie możliwości modeli i ich przecenianie. Jedną z fundamentalnych cech ludzkiego umysłu jest tendencja do rzutowania intencji, wiary i wiedzy na otaczające rzeczy. Jeżeli na kamieniu narysujemy uśmiechniętą twarz, to będziemy mieli wrażenie, że ten kamień jest szczęśliwy. W odniesieniu do uczenia głębokiego oznacza to np., że jeżeli uda nam się wytrenować działający poprawnie model generujący podpisy rysunków, to może nam się wydać, że model „rozumie” to, co znajduje się na rysunku. W takim przypadku zostaniemy niemile zaskoczeni przez absurdalne opisy generowane przez model w odniesieniu do obrazów spoza treningowego zbioru danych (patrz rysunek 9.1).

#### Python for DevOps (Noah Gift, Kennedy Behrman, Alfredo Deza, and Grig Gheorghiu)
      Do one right thing, then another, until you find clarity. First, set up a build server, start testing your code, and automate manual tasks. Do something; it can be anything, but have a “bias for action.” Do that first thing right and make sure it is automated.

      Many abstract concepts in the software industry are hard to define precisely. Cloud Computing, Agile, and Big Data are good examples of topics that can have many definitions depending on whom you talk to.

      Your curiosity and a never-ending pursuit of knowledge will continue to make you, and the environments you work on, much better.

      Instead of a hierarchy based on complete nonsense, a better approach to building reliable systems is to build them piece by piece. In additional, when creating the platform, failure should be expected regularly. The only thing that will affect this truism is if a powerful person is involved in building the architecture. In that case, this truism will be exponentially increased.

      No matter how smart/powerful/charismatic/creative/rich a person is, if they are manually applying critical changes in a crisis to your software platform, you are already dead. You just don’t know it yet. The alternative to this monstrous existence is automation.

      The same concept can be applied to Python, the language. Fully accepting the strengths and weaknesses of the language allows a developer to utilize it fully. Python is not a high-performance language. Python is not a language optimized for writing servers like other languages are: Go, Java, C, C++, C#, or Erlang. Instead, Python is a language for applying high-level logic on top of high-performance code written in a high-performance language or platform. Python is widely popular because

#### Why Most Things Fail (Ormerod, Paul)
      An argument I first made ten years ago in my book The Death of Economics noted that conventional economics views the economy and society as machines, whose behaviour, no matter how complicated, is ultimately predictable and controllable. On the contrary, however, human society is more like a living organism. My previous book, Butterfly Economics,

      The third theme, developed in particular towards the end of the book, is that failure can be highly beneficial. In the real world in which strategies evolve and which is itself the outcome of a dynamic process of change, failure at the level of the individual component part can, paradoxically, enhance the fitness of the system as a whole.

      laconically, ‘The tendency to overemphasize successes, and to rationalize them ex post is chronically endemic amongst business historians and management consultants.’

      Books proliferate, and occasionally sell in very large numbers, which claim to have found the rule, or small set of rules, which will guarantee business success. But business is far too complicated, far too difficult an activity to distil into a few simple commands, be it the ‘set price equal to marginal cost’ of economic theory, or some of the more exotic exhortations of the business gurus. It is failure rather than success which is the distinguishing feature of corporate life.

      We will see that economic theory neglects almost completely the widespread existence of corporate failure.

      P. J. O’Rourke, in his entertaining book Eat the Rich, has a stimulating definition of the content of the subject: ‘One thing that economists do know is that the study of economics is divided into two fields, “microeconomics” and “macroeconomics”. Micro is the study of individual behaviour, and macro is the study of how economies behave as a whole. That is, microeconomics concerns things that economists are specifically wrong about, while macroeconomics concerns things economists are wrong about generally.’

      over 10 per cent of all companies in the US, the largest and most successful economy in the history of the world, fail every single year.

      particular within economics, there is a difference to be drawn. Risk refers to situations in which the outcome cannot be known with certainty, but the probability of any given outcome is understood perfectly.

      Uncertainty, in its strict sense, refers to situations in which the probability of the various outcomes is itself unknown.

      And despite enormous increases in the number of air travellers in the second half of the twentieth century, the combined profit made by airlines over the period 1955–2000 was less than the losses they incurred in just the two years 2001 and 2002.

      of the century, the scope of the state increased markedly. In every western country, the size of state activity in the economy was considerably greater in 2000 than it was in 1950. In Britain, for example, in the middle of the twentieth century the most openly socialist administration in the history of the country was in power, but government spending as a percentage of the economy was lower then than it was under Mrs Thatcher in the 1980s.

      By the turn of the century, almost 20 per cent of total national income in many countries in the European Union was diverted to subsidies for the poor, tax-break payments to households and other social benefits. Even in the United States, the comparable figure was over 10 per cent. In total, government spending accounted for as much as 48 per cent of national income in the EU and 36 per cent in the US.

      Yet despite the efforts of western governments for at least half a century, not only do social problems persist, but from time to time they appear to intensify. Society becomes less and not more equal. Social policies aimed at reducing inequality appear to fail.

      The New York Times in January 2003 reported on a study of social mobility in America. Sociologists Robert Perrucci and Earl Wysong analyzed the incomes and occupations of 2,749 fathers and sons between 1970 and the late 1990s. They concluded that social mobility had fallen sharply. As they became adults, children became more likely over this period to retain the class privileges or disadvantages of their parents. Studies in Britain also show a marked fall in social mobility over a similar timescale, from around the late 1960s to the present day. These outcomes cannot be ascribed in a simplistic way to ‘Reaganism’ or ‘Thatcherism’, because the trends were already established well before these often demonized figures ever came to power and have continued long after they lost it.

      Collecting data to estimate the Gini over long periods of time is extremely difficult. Estimates in recent years, for example, depend a great deal on the information available in the records of the income-tax authorities. Most adults in the west now either pay tax on their income or receive income in the form of benefits from the state. Indeed, given the massive complications of most tax and benefit systems, many people both pay tax and receive benefits in one form or another. The point here is that reasonably reliable information now exists on the individual incomes of almost all adults. For most of history, and even for the history of the last two hundred years of industrial capitalism, this was not the case. State spending as a proportion of the overall economy was much lower, and so most people were not required to pay income tax.

      In other words, the distribution of income within countries is fluid and dynamic, sometimes appearing to be stable, then moving suddenly in one direction or the other. There is a tendency over a long period of time for income to be more equitably distributed, but around this trend there are irregular fluctuations of various sizes and lengths of time.

      areas of the world, for colonization was

      The current-day pessimists are completely wrong when they repeatedly assert that the world as a whole is becoming more unequal. For the first time in the history of capitalism, the distribution of world income between countries became more equal in the second half of the twentieth century, and in particular during its final quarter. The economic successes in Asia have liberated many, many millions of people from lives of unremitting drudgery and toil, and have reduced world income inequality. But, just as with the movements over time in inequality within nations, changes in global inequality have not happened smoothly.

      The dimensions of the problem that confronts policy-makers in trying to decide strategy, with many different factors affecting the outcome of any decision, are too large to be grasped in their entirety. In these circumstances, there is ample scope for decisions to go wrong. In short, there is ample scope for strategy to fail at any point in time.

      In order to control a system – any system, whether an economy, a biological system or a machine – we need to be able to do two things: first, make forecasts which are reasonably accurate in a systematic way over time; and second, understand with reasonable accuracy the effect of changes in policy on the system one is trying to control.

      Unless policy-makers know with reasonable confidence what state the system is likely to be in at some point in the future, it is not possible to say what action is required now in order to bring about a more desirable outcome. And unless the authorities understand the impact of their actions, it is not possible to know what should be done in order to bring about any desired outcome. The scope for failure abounds.

      The Economist magazine reported in February 2003 that American schools were more segmented on racial lines than they were in the 1960s. And it was precisely in the 1960s that major initiatives began to be taken to improve integration and break down the old racial barriers.

      The rules of the Schelling game appear to be – and indeed are – simple, but they give rise to complex, and unanticipated, behaviour of the system.

      Criticisms of the conventional economic account of how markets work must not, of course, be confused with criticism of markets as such. Markets clearly work in practice, and work in general to the benefit of humanity. But, a century after Marshall, to quote Nobel laureate Vernon Smith again, ‘We do not understand why markets work as they do.’

      A key paradox begins to emerge from all this. Humans, whether acting as individuals or making collective decisions in companies or governments, behave with purpose. They take decisions with the aim of achieving specific, desired outcomes. Yet our view of the world which is emerging is one in which it is either very difficult or even impossible to predict the consequences of decisions in any meaningful sense.

      Our understanding of the consequences of decisions we take today on our future well-being, on our fitness for survival, appears to be very limited. Companies want not merely to survive but to make profits and prosper. Yet, as we have seen, they often fail. Governments want to achieve all kinds of desirable social goals, yet they, too, often fail.

      So a CEO of a giant company at the height of his powers misjudged entirely the consequences of his attempted management buyout. He thought he would succeed. He failed. He thought the company could be bought for some $70 a share. It was eventually sold at over $100.

      Running a business is, as we have seen, much harder than playing chess. It is also much harder than analyzing the Hotelling location model, or playing the Hotelling location game, as we might think of it. Even making dramatic simplifications of reality, we cannot really draw any definite conclusions from this game unless we are in possession of immense detail concerning consumer preferences and, even more difficult, the intentions of our potential rivals. And if we cannot make firm recommendations or give clear-cut advice to players of this game, how can we possibly hope to do any better when advising firms who face this problem in real life?

      ‘There are four stages of acceptance: i) this is worthless nonsense; ii) this is an interesting, but perverse, point of view; iii) this is true, but quite unimportant; iv) I always said so.’

      Policies which try to contain percolation across such networks are very hard to implement. Unless each one of the very small number of highly connected individuals is

      targeted effectively and immunized, the virus will persist. Immunization at random of even a large proportion of the population will simply not succeed, unless purely by chance not just some but all of the highly connected are caught.

      In a purely economic context, firms can interact in ways which damage each other’s fitness for survival. They can, for example, become involved in a price war, the end result of which is simply to reduce each other’s profits. A less obvious example was the decision by the food superstores in Britain to open on Sundays some fifteen years ago. Legislation had made it possible for the first time, but the companies hesitated. Nevertheless, as soon as one began Sunday opening, the others were compelled to follow for fear of losing market share. However, the total sales passing through these stores did not increase as a result, for shoppers already had ample opportunity to visit the stores during the rest of the week. The consumers were happier, but all the companies themselves ended up incurring higher costs, through the extra wages paid on the Sunday, for example, with no increase in sales.

      In short, despite the ability of humans and human institutions to act with intent, in reality it is as if they operate close to the paradigm of the agent with zero cognitive ability. They do not have to mimic it completely, and a small amount of ability to translate intent into desired outcome is compatible with the evidence we observe, but no more than that.

      To repeat a key phrase which needs to be hard-wired into the brain of every decision-maker, whether in the public or private sector, intent is not the same as outcome.

      Hayek attacked conventional economic theory at an even deeper level. His achievement was to show that, theoretically, market-based economies are inherently superior to planned ones. Paradoxically, conventional free-market economic theory cannot demonstrate this result. Indeed, it is equally relevant to the idealized world of both the central planner and the pure free market.

      It was Hayek’s genius to offer a completely different, and much more realistic, view of how economies operate. In a Hayekian world, decentralized decision-making by individual agents is unequivocally superior to central planning. Indeed, a central plan may well be the worst possible institutional framework an economy could have.

      Hayek’s view is much more rooted in biology. Individual behaviour is not fixed, like a screw or cog in a machine is, but evolves in response to the behaviour of others. Control and prediction of the system as a whole is simply not possible.

      For Hayek, ‘an economist who is only an economist cannot be a good economist’.

      creating the risk that it will happen again. Much more generally, it is innovation,

      Much more generally, it is innovation, evolution and competition which are the hallmarks of a successful system. This is a fundamental message from Hayek and Schumpeter which shines to us across the decades.

      So a demanding and competitive external environment is essential for the health of the system as whole. But economic regulators, with the possible exception of the US authorities, are obsessed with something entirely different. Their mission in life is to promote competition within the system, to increase the level of competition between the individual agents inside the system.

      Hayek emphasized the importance of the process of the evolution of strategy, of discovering new and more effective ways of doing things. Both these views imply that strong market positions will be created temporarily for particularly successful innovators. They will be able to exercise market power and raise their profit margins. This is the reward to innovation at the individual level but, as we have seen, this also brings benefits to the system as a whole.

      In terms of the public policy implications, the authorities need to recognize that within a single industry co-operative relationships between firms are necessary for the fitness of the industry as whole. If competition is enforced too strongly, the overall fitness of the industry is reduced. But protection for the industry as a whole also tends to reduce overall fitness. Firms need an external environment which is competitive but require a certain level of co-operative behaviour between each other within the industry.

      The point is not to ridicule such policies, though each has its own particular streak of lunacy. Almost every reader will be able to come up with similar stories. The point is that the state, at both national and local level, now feels obliged to intervene, to have policies regarding almost every aspect of life. Whether walking, jogging or riding a bike, teams of inspectors are on hand to endeavour to ensure that targets are met on these various means of locomotion. Indeed, the current British government has announced no fewer than 8,000 numerical targets since coming to power in 1997.

      Administering public policy is a far more complicated task, and the dimensions of the problem are even greater than those described by our models and games. Not surprisingly, the cast of mind which believes in detailed planning and monitoring usually fails.

#### Philosophical Investigations: Volume 85 (The Macat Library) (O' Sullivan, Michael)
      In epistemology, contextualism is the view that what counts as knowledge in one context may not count as knowledge in another. I may believe I know, for everyday purposes, that a colleague is trustworthy. But if I am a witness in a court of law, where higher standards of evidence are demanded, I may not count on knowing this. Wittgenstein put forward something like this view in his late work On Certainty, but it also has roots in Investigations.

      Design tests that cover your risks as efficiently as possible Automate tests rapidly, with minimal maintenance See the risk impact of your test failures Identify critical “blind spots” that are not yet tested Prepare your automation for constant, consistent execution within CI Balance test automation with creative exploration

      With risk coverage, the focus shifts from the number of requirements tested to the risk weight of the requirements tested. You can usually achieve much higher risk coverage by testing 10 critical requirements than you can by testing 100 more trivial ones.

      Simplify automation across the technology stack End the test maintenance nightmare Shift to API testing whenever feasible

      Choose the right tool(s) for your needs

      Test automation is perfect for repeatedly checking whether incremental application changes break your existing functionality. However, test automation falls short for determining if new functionality truly meets expectations. Does it address the business needs behind the user story? Does it do so in a way that’s easy to use, resource-efficient, reliable, and consistent with the rest of your application?

#### Explore It!: Reduce Risk and Increase Confidence with Exploratory Testing (Hendrickson, Elisabeth)
      There is the philosophical question: How do we know what we know? There is the economic question: When will we know enough to move forward with confidence? There is the psychological question: How do we convince each other that one more change is needed, or is not needed?

      “It is so frustrating,” she sighed. “No matter how many tests we write, no matter how many cases we execute, we always find the most serious bugs when we go off the script.”

      Your exploration has answered all the open questions, and you know of no more unknowns.  You are not learning anything new. You have characterized the capabilities, limitations, and risks of the existing implementation. As a result, you feel like you are dealing with a known quantity with no more surprises to be uncovered, at least for now.  More information will not change anything. You could gather more information, but there is no point. Your stakeholders have explicitly told you they do not need or want more information from exploring, and you know that no one will act on any information you find, including you.  Other information has more value. Perhaps you could find more information in a given area, but there are other, more pressing questions to address in other areas or on other charters.

      This is the essence of testing: designing an experiment to gather empirical evidence to answer a question about a risk.

      The principle of strategy is having one thing, to know ten thousand things.

      It will seem difficult at first, but everything is difficult at first. Bows are difficult to draw, halberds are difficult to wield;

      You should not have a favourite weapon. To become over-familiar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well. You should not copy others, but use weapons which you can handle properly. It is bad for commanders and troopers to have likes and dislikes. These are things you must learn thoroughly.

      In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness.

#### Meditations (Inti Classics): by Marcus Aurelius (Aurelius, Marcus)
      Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.

      Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor the tranquility which others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept erect by others.

      The universe is transformation: life is opinion.

      and to how many ill-minded folks thou hast shown a kind disposition.  Why do unskilled and ignorant souls disturb him who has skill and knowledge? What soul then has skill and knowledge? That which knows beginning and end, and knows

      the reason which pervades all substance and through all time by fixed periods (revolutions) administers the universe.

      If a thing is difficult to be accomplished by thyself, do not think that it is impossible for man: but if anything is possible for man and conformable to his nature, think that this can be attained by thyself too.

      It is in our power to have no opinion about a thing, and not to be disturbed in our soul; for things themselves have no natural power to form our judgements.

      Where any work can be done conformably to the reason which is common to gods and men, there we have nothing to fear: for where we are able to get profit by means of the activity which is successful and proceeds according to our constitution, there no harm is to be suspected.

      In every pain let this thought be present, that there is no dishonour in it, nor does it make the governing intelligence worse, for it does not damage the intelligence either so far as the intelligence is rational or so far as it is social. Indeed in the case of most pains let this remark of Epicurus aid thee, that pain is neither intolerable nor everlasting, if thou bearest in mind that it has its limits, and if thou addest nothing to it in imagination: and remember this too, that we do not perceive that many things which are disagreeable to us are the same as pain, such as excessive drowsiness, and the being scorched by heat, and the having no appetite. When then thou art discontented about any of these things, say to thyself, that thou art yielding to pain.

      It is thy duty to order thy life well in every single act; and if every act does its duty, as far as is possible, be content;

      Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance; and be ready to let it go.

      If any man has done wrong, the harm is his own. But perhaps he has not done wrong.

      No longer talk at all about the kind of man that a good man ought to be, but be such.

      Eighth, consider how much more pain is brought on us by the anger and vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves, at which we are angry and vexed.

#### Hackers  
      Mistrust Authority—Promote Decentralization.

      The best way to promote this free exchange of information is to have an open system, something that presents no boundaries between a hacker and a piece of information or an item of equipment that he needs in his quest for knowledge, improvement, and time online. The last thing you need is a bureaucracy. Bureaucracies, whether corporate, government, or university, are flawed systems, dangerous in that they cannot accommodate the exploratory impulse of true hackers.

It’s worth citing his comment, uttered off the cuff at a session I hosted called “The Future of the Hacker Ethic,” because it’s so often misquoted. “On one hand, information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable,” Brand said. “The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.”

      Believe whatever you believe by day; but at night, argue against the propositions you hold most dear. Don’t cheat! To the greatest extent possible you have to think as though you believe what you don’t believe. And if you can’t talk yourself out of your existing beliefs, you’ll know a lot more about why you believe what you believe. You’ll have come a little closer to a proof.

      Every time you observe that more of a good thing is not always better; or you remember that improbable things happen a lot, given enough chances, and resist the lure of the Baltimore stockbroker; or you make a decision based not just on the most likely future, but on the cloud of all possible futures, with attention to which ones are likely and which ones are not; or you let go of the idea that the beliefs of groups should be subject to the same rules as beliefs of individuals; or, simply, you find that cognitive sweet spot where you can let your intuition run wild on the network of tracks formal reasoning makes for it; without writing down an equation or drawing a graph, you are doing mathematics, the extension of common sense by other means. When are you going to use it? You’ve been using mathematics since you were born and you’ll probably never stop. Use it well.

#### Practical Statistics for Data Scientists (Bruce, Peter;Bruce, Andrew;Gedeck, Peter)
      The real problem is that people want more meaning from the p-value than it contains. Here’s what we would like the p-value to convey: The probability that the result is due to chance. We hope for a low value, so we can conclude that we’ve proved something. This is how many journal editors were interpreting the p-value. But here’s what the p-value actually represents: The probability that, given a chance model, results as extreme as the observed results could occur.

      P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model. P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.

#### UFOs (Kean, Leslie)
      In short, a group of scientists selected by the CIA advised our government to encourage all agencies within the intelligence community to influence mass media and infiltrate civilian research groups for the purpose of debunking UFOs.

      McDonald testified that no other problem within their jurisdiction compared to this one. “The scientific community, not only in this country but throughout the world, has been casually ignoring as nonsense a matter of extraordinary scientific importance.”

      Yves Sillard, unknown to most Americans, is a man of stature within the European space community. He founded what has become the world’s most effective agency investigating UFOs more than thirty years ago, and still plays a leading role in directing that agency today.

      now know for certain, that silent and completely unknown objects sometimes penetrate our airspace with flying capabilities that are impossible to replicate on Earth. And these objects appear to be operated by some kind of intelligence. The COMETA Report shows, in a straightforward manner, that the extraterrestrial hypothesis is the most rational explanation, although of course it has not been proven.

      First, it is possible to show, using data from established cases officially listed throughout the world, that UFOs—material objects—exist and are distinct from any ordinary phenomena.

      These cases are few, but their extraordinary characteristics and physical effects demonstrate this fact without ambiguity.

      On the basis of well-established cases, the existence of UFOs is without question.

      A classification was adopted that places the UAP (unidentified aerospace phenomena) in four categories: Type A: The phenomenon is fully and unambiguously identified. Type B: The nature of the phenomenon has probably been identified but some doubt remains. Type C: The phenomenon cannot be identified or classified due to insufficient data. Type D: The phenomenon cannot be explained despite precise witness accounts and good-quality evidence recovered from the scene.

      By comparing nuclear tests to some 150 visual/radar UFO cases collected since 1947, we note that the curves are practically superimposed in time and that they coincide, with not more than a few months appearing between the number of explosions and one of the UFO appearances. This similarity in the two curves would suggest that the proven presence of UFOs is related to the nuclear strategic activity in the world. I base my hypothesis on my studies of official documents, the places and zones of UFO sightings, and remarks made by highly placed civilian and military persons involved in secret programs. There have been numerous instances of UFOs flying over or near strategic air command and other military bases in the United States, especially as documented during the 1960s.

      After my many years studying the most important unexplained cases, I think we have reached a certain level of knowledge about UFOs. They seem to be artificial and controlled objects whose physical characteristics

      can be measured by our detection systems, radar in particular. They fall under a physics which is by far superior and more evolved than the one we have in our most technologically advanced countries, highlighted by the stationary and silent flights, the accelerations and speeds defying the laws of inertia, the effects on the electronic navigation or transmission systems of aircraft, and the electrical blackouts.

      These performances have been shown on radar. When military aircrafts are directly involved, these objects are able to anticipate and neutralize the maneuvers of the pilots assigned to security and defense missions, and some remarkable cases show the capacity of the UFOs to seemingly understand a particular situation or to anticipate intentions of escape or military neutralization. The UFO phenomenon is definitely related to something controlled and intelligent.

      Dr. James Harder, a University of California professor of civil engineering, told the House Science and Astronautics Committee in its 1968 hearing2: “On the basis of the data and ordinary rules of evidence, as would be applied in civil or criminal courts, the physical reality of UFOs has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”

      So what did we get? After four years and 460 pages of analysis, had we solved the UFO mystery? Well, no, we hadn’t. What we got was a comprehensive drawing together of some existing research, coupled with some exotic new theories. “That UAP exist is indisputable,” the Executive Summary states, before going on to say that no evidence has been found to suggest that they are “hostile or under any type of control.” But by its own admission, the report has not provided a definitive explanation of the phenomenon: “The study cannot offer the certainty of explanation of all UAP phenomena,” it says, leaving the door open.

      I do know one thing, without a doubt: These objects were under intelligent control.

      In summary, I am convinced that UFOs exist and are a reality that cannot remain unacknowledged by governments.

      The phenomena are evident in all parts of the world and no efforts in their study should be neglected.

      Personally, according to my best judgment, I am in agreement with the findings of the French COMETA Report: There is a high probability UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin.

      The events of that night were really amazing, and some of our simple questions have simple answers: Did the pilots see the phenomena? Yes. Did the radars spot them? Yes. Did Ozires and other military pilots see them? Yes. Did pilots in commercial aircraft see them? Yes. Do the times of the sightings correlate? Yes. Do the trajectories of the objects correlate? Yes; all of this was technically analyzed. So, did it happen? Yes, it did happen.

      Everything was spotted by both aircraft radars and the radars on the ground. On-board radars operate in a microwave band, which is very narrow, while ground radars operate in a much broader band, so there’s no risk of confusion or mistaken correlation.

      Dr. Richard C. Henry, a prominent professor of astrophysics at Johns Hopkins University, was then deputy director of NASA’s Astrophysics Division and involved in the decision-making process. In a 1988 published essay, Henry takes issue with Frosch’s claim of “an absence of tangible or physical evidence.” He says there was an abundance of relevant evidence at the time, a situation that he, as head of the Astrophysics Division, was certainly aware of.

      At the end, one of the three people from the CIA said, “This event never happened; we were never here. We’re confiscating all this data, and you are all sworn to secrecy.” “What do you think it was?” I asked the CIA person. “A UFO, and this is the first time they have over thirty minutes of radar data to go over,” he responded. They—the president’s scientific team—were very excited to get their hands on this data.

      “Well, let’s get a Twix out and advise the American public that we were visited by a UFO,”1 I suggested. “No way. If we were to tell the American public there are UFOs, they would panic,” he informed me.

      Between 8:00 and 8:30 on the evening of March 13, 1997, during my second term as governor of Arizona, I witnessed something that defied logic and challenged my reality: a massive, delta-shaped craft silently navigating over the Squaw Peak in the Phoenix Mountain preserve. A solid structure rather than an apparition, it was dramatically large, with a distinctive leading edge embedded with lights as it traveled the Arizona skies. I still don’t know what it was. As a pilot and a former Air Force officer, I can say with certainty that this craft did not resemble any man-made object I had ever seen.

      The same incident was witnessed by hundreds if not thousands of people in Arizona, and my office was at once besieged with phone calls from concerned Arizonians. Even so, I managed to keep my head down—until two months later, when a story about the sightings appeared in USA Today. Catalyzed by the article, hysteria intensified to a point that I decided to lighten the mood and add a note of levity by calling a press conference at which my chief of staff arrived in alien costume. Originally my idea, this was one my team immediately embraced with enthusiasm. Not only would it dampen any incipient panic, it would show the human face of those who hold public office.

      Yet, the reality is that UFOs are not matters of belief, but facts. Many thousands of reports worldwide describe unexplained objects in the sky. Most consist only of eyewitness testimony, which might be disregarded as unreliable—and some undoubtedly actually are—but the fact that many UFO reports come from “expert witnesses” like commercial and air force pilots, air traffic controllers, cosmonauts, and scientists should give one pause. However, some UFO reports are also corroborated by physical evidence, including scientifically analyzed photo and video images, physical ground traces affecting plants and soil, effects on aircraft, and anomalous radar tracks. In modern society, physical evidence is normally considered definitive evidence of reality, objective evidence for something that has a cause in the physical world. By this criterion, then, at least some UFOs are clearly real. The question that makes them a problem is: Could they be extraterrestrial?

      There is more than enough evidence to determine that something physical is there.

#### The 48 Laws Of Power (The Robert Greene Collection) (Greene, Robert)
      The problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as you imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend each other. They laugh extra hard at each other’s jokes. Since honesty rarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in clothes—maybe they mean it, often they do not.

      All working situations require a kind of distance between people. You are trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false) only obscures that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best able to further your interests in all situations. Keep friends for friendship, but work with the skilled and competent.

      One oft-told tale about Kissinger … involved a report that Winston Lord had worked on for days. After giving it to Kissinger, he got it back with the notation, “Is this the best you can do?” Lord rewrote and polished and finally resubmitted it; back it came with the same curt question. After redrafting it one more time—and once again getting the same question from Kissinger—Lord snapped, “Damn it, yes, it’s the best I can do.” To which Kissinger replied: “Fine, then I guess I’ll read it this time.”

#### Complexity (Mitchell, Melanie)
      Now I can propose a definition of the term complex system: a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution.

      Systems in which organized behavior arises without an internal or external controller or leader are sometimes called self-organizing. Since simple rules produce complex behavior in hard-to-predict ways, the macroscopic behavior of such systems is sometimes called emergent. Here is an alternative definition of a complex system: a system that exhibits nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors.

      Seemingly random behavior can emerge from deterministic systems, with no external source of randomness. The behavior of some simple, deterministic systems can be impossible, even in principle, to predict in the long term, due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

      Although the detailed behavior of a chaotic system cannot be predicted, there is some “order in chaos” seen in universal properties common to large sets of chaotic systems, such as the period-doubling route to chaos and Feigenbaum’s constant. Thus even though “prediction becomes impossible” at the detailed level, there are some higher-level aspects of chaotic systems that are indeed predictable.

      Entropy is a measure of the energy that cannot be converted into additional work. The term “entropy” comes from another Greek word—“trope”—meaning “turning into” or “transformation.”

      Turing’s proof of the uncomputability of the Halting problem, sketched above, uses precisely the same core idea as Gödel’s incompleteness proof. Gödel figured out a way to encode mathematical statements so that they could talk about themselves. Turing figured out a way to encode mathematical statements as Turing machines and thus run on one another.

      Natural selection is the major mechanism of evolutionary change and adaptation.

      Evolution is a gradual process, occurring via natural selection on very small random variations in individuals. Variation of this sort is highly abundant in populations and is not biased in any direction (e.g., it does not intrinsically lead to “improvement,” as believed by Lamarck). The source of individual variation is random genetic mutations and recombinations. Macroscale phenomena, such as the origin of new species, can be explained by the microscopic process of gene variation and natural selection.

      Furthermore, Gould and his colleagues attacked the third pillar of the Synthesis by proposing that some of the large-scale phenomena of evolution cannot be explained

      “The [IAS] School of Mathematics has a permanent establishment which is divided into three groups, one consisting of pure mathematics, one consisting of theoretical physicists, and one consisting of Professor von Neumann.”

      Wolfram’s proposed principle consists of four parts: The proper way to think about processes in nature is that they are computing. Since even very simple rules (or “programs”) such as Rule 110 can support universal computation, the ability to support universal computation is very common in nature. Universal computation is an upper limit on the complexity of computations in nature. That is, no natural system or process can produce behavior that is “noncomputable.” The computations done by different processes in nature are almost always equivalent in sophistication.

      Open-source software shows the potential of social norms. In the case of Linux and other collaborative projects, you can post a problem about a bug on one of the bulletin boards and see how fast someone, or often many people, will react to your request and fix the software—using their own leisure time. Could you pay for this level of service? Most likely. But if you had to hire people of the same caliber they would cost you an arm and a leg. Rather, people in these communities are happy to give their time to society at large (for which they get the same social benefits we all get from helping a friend paint a room).

      If this were not enough, some of the objects were found to be emitting radio waves, in one case at the 8 hertz (Hz), 14 megahertz (MHz), and 19 gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. All natural, terrestrial objects emit electromagnetic radiation—ranging from long-frequency radio waves to short-frequency microwaves, depending on their temperature. However, in the case of the objects retrieved by Dr.

      In English the differences between things and

      Reasonable–that is, human–men will always be capable of compromise, but men who have dehumanized themselves by becoming the blind worshipers of an idea or an ideal are fanatics whose devotion to abstractions makes them the enemies of life.

      But in Zen, and in other schools of the Mahayana, it is often taken in a more figurative way, as that the process of rebirth is from moment to moment, so that one is being reborn so long as one identifies himself with a continuing ego which reincarnates itself afresh at each moment of time.

#### Skinwalkers at the Pentagon: An Insiders' Account of the Secret Government UFO Program (Lacatski, James)
      Meeting its deadline, the UAP Task Force released a report on June 25, 2021, confirming that the U.S. government acknowledges UAPs exist.

      Between September 2008 and December 2010, the Pentagon spent those millions investigating UAPs as well as the paranormal and psychic correlates to UAPs.

      the AAWSAP contract to evaluate the threat potential of UAPs. Throughout this book, “AAWSAP”, “BAASS” and “AAWSAP BAASS” are used interchangeably to denote close operational similarity. AAWSAP was not conceived to study projected advances in aerospace technology, except in relation to UAPs.

      AAWSAP BAASS was not AATIP. The AATIP moniker arose from an

      unclassified nickname that was inserted into a letter that was sent from Senator Harry Reid to the Deputy Secretary of Defense requesting the creation of a Special Access Program (SAP). This letter is described fully in Chapter 10. Because Lacatski, the DIA program manager, wished to protect the AAWSAP name for security reasons, AATIP was a “made up” substitute name for Reid’s letter to describe the AAWSAP.

      BAASS would like to carefully use the property it owns in the Uintah Basin of Utah and the Uintah Basin in general as a living laboratory. For more than a hundred years and especially in the last sixty-five years this area is commonly known to have frequent exhibitions of anomalous spacecraft and other objects.

      The report stated bluntly that the UAP phenomenon is a threat to human health and well-being. The AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse comprised many hundreds of UAP-human interactions that were classified as close encounters involving injury or death to the witness.

#### Rules for Radicals (Alinsky, Saul D.)
      “When Mr. Alinsky told us we were full of shit, that was the first time a white man has really talked to us as equals—you would never say that to us. You would always say ‘Well, I can see your point of view but I’m a little

      confused,’ and stuff like that. In other words you treat us as children.”

      The fourth rule carries within it the fifth rule: Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage.

      Three of the questions were on the philosophy and motivations of Saul Alinsky. I answered two of them incorrectly. I did not know what my philosophy or motivations were; but they did!

      While the accounting was mark-to-market, it wasn’t being handled the old-fashioned way, with trading prices dictating values; instead, Enron was using its own projections to fold anticipated income from decades-long contracts into the current year. It struck her as horribly aggressive. What if the other party to the contract went bankrupt? What if energy taxes changed? If, oh, natural gas was outlawed? This newfangled accounting seemed highly risky, and Mack thought investors needed to know about it.

      Strange. An Enron executive was negotiating with an Enron executive—to sell something from Enron? Not his place to question.

      The company had hit the earnings projections. The fire drill of the last few weeks brought in not only almost $500 million in cash flow but also around $125 million in profits—about half what Wall Street hoped the business would generate in the fourth quarter. All it took was paper shuffling, accounting errors, and some sweetheart deals. That, and a few crimes.

      What the state had described as deregulation was in fact a labyrinth of complex—and often contradictory—rules, combining the worst features of both government bureaucracy and unbridled capitalism.

      By ‘God’ I mean an entity than which no greater can be thought. Suppose that God, so defined, does not exist; I can nevertheless think that he exists. But an entity is greater if it does exist than if it does not. Hence it is possible to think of something greater than God—namely an entity which is not only greater than any that can be thought, but which also exists. But this is contrary to the definition.

      But the spirit of the depths stepped up to me and said: “What you speak is. The greatness is, the intoxication is, the undignified, sick, paltry dailiness is. It runs in all the streets, lives in all the houses, and rules the day of all humanity. Even the eternal stars are commonplace. It is the great mistress and the one essence of God. One laughs

      But the spirit of the depths said: “No one can or should halt sacrifice. Sacrifice is not destruction, sacrifice is the foundation stone of what is to come. Have you not had monasteries? Have not countless thousands gone into the desert? You should carry the monastery in yourself. The desert is within you. The desert calls you and draws you back, and if you were fettered to the world of this time with iron, the call of the desert would break all chains. Truly, I prepare you for solitude.”

      The God appears to us in a certain state of the soul. Therefore we reach the God through the self.34 35 Not the self is God, although we reach the God through the self. The God is behind the self, above the self, the self itself, when he appears. But he appears as our sickness, from which we must heal ourselves.36We must heal ourselves from the God, since he is also our heaviest wound.

      I must free my self from the God,39 since the God I experienced is more than love; he is also hate, he is more than beauty, he is also the abomination, he is more than wisdom, he is also meaninglessness, he is more than power, he is also powerlessness, he is more than omnipresence, he is also my creature.

      Then the one which is not, if it is to maintain itself, must have the being of not-being as the bond of not-being, just as being must have as a bond the not-being of not-being in order to perfect its own being; for the truest assertion of the being of being and of the not-being of not-being is when being partakes of the being of being, and not of the being of not- being—that is, the perfection of being; and when not-being does not partake of the not-being of not-being but of the being of not-being—that is the perfection of not-being.

      STRANGER: Then now, Theaetetus, his art may be traced as a branch of the appropriative, acquisitive family—which hunts animals,—living—land—tame animals; which hunts man,—privately—for hire,—taking money in exchange— having the semblance of education; and this is termed Sophistry, and is a hunt after young men of wealth and rank—such is the conclusion.

      STRANGER: Then we must admit, and not object to say, that motion is the same and is not the same, for we do not apply the terms ‘same’ and ‘not the same,’ in the same sense; but we call it the ‘same,’ in relation to itself, because partaking of the same; and not the same, because having communion with the other, it is thereby severed from the same, and has become not that but other, and is therefore rightly spoken of as ‘not the same.’

      Nothing can be plainer. STRANGER: Then not-being necessarily exists in the case of motion and of every class; for the nature of the other entering into them all, makes each of them other than being, and so non-existent; and therefore of all of them, in like manner, we may truly say that they are not; and again, inasmuch as they partake of being, that they are and are existent.

      Then, as would appear, the opposition of a part of the other, and of a part of being, to one another, is, if I may venture to say so, as truly essence as being itself, and implies not the opposite of being, but only what is other than being.

      And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as first principles, but only as hypotheses— that is to say, as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.

      At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and intellect with being;

      Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.

      individual, and begin with the government of honor?—I know of no name for such a government other than timocracy or perhaps timarchy.

      First, then, I said, let us inquire how timocracy (the government of honor) arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best). Clearly, all political changes originate in divisions

      100 cubes of three (27 x 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400 = 8000). Now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of births.

      For when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom out of season, the children will not be goodly or fortunate

      Let there be a general rule that everyone shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and there will be less of this scandalous moneymaking, and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.

      Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, tyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider.

      He will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free and enrol them in his body-guard. To be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.

      Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men—lovers of wisdom, lovers of honor, lovers of gain?

      In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in order. But whether such a one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no matter;

      sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways, and incrustations have grown over them of sea-weed and shells and stones, so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form.

#### The Master and His Emissary (McGilchrist, Iain)
      pathways to the truth: science, reason, intuition and imagination. I also believe strongly that any world view that tries to get by without paying due respect to all four of these is bound to fail.

      Another area where analytic retrospection misleads us as to the nature of what we are seeing, since it reconstructs the world according to left-hemisphere principles, is that of morality.

      Philosophers spend a good deal of time inspecting and analysing processes that are usually – and perhaps must remain – implicit, unconscious, intuitive; in other words, examining the life of the right hemisphere from the standpoint of the left.

      Schizophrenics, like philosophers, have a problem with the sense of the self which ordinary individuals, involved with living, lack.

      Communication occurs because, in a necessarily limited, but nonetheless crucially important, sense, we come to feel what it is like to be the person who is communicating with us. This explains why we pick up another person’s speech habits or tics,

      So language is a hybrid. It evolved from music and in this part of its history represented the urge to communicate; and to the extent that it retains right-hemisphere empathic elements, it still does. Its foundations lie in the body and the world of experience. But referential language, with its huge vocabulary and sophisticated syntax, did not originate in a drive to communicate, and from this point of view, represents something of a hijack. It has done everything it can to repudiate both its bodily origins and its dependency on experience – to become a world unto itself.

      We cannot give them our understanding, only awaken their own, latent, understanding.

      ‘it is being that speaks within us, and not we who speak of being’; and again, ‘it is not we who perceive, it is the thing that perceives itself yonder’.

      ‘Philosophy begins and ends with wondering – profound wondering.’

      ‘thoughts are the shadows of our feelings—always darker, emptier, simpler’.

      The evidence from McNeill’s work is that – temporally, logically and ontologically – the right-hemisphere world grounds that of the left.

      The frontal lobes are indisputably the parts of the brain that make us most human, that bring about for us all the greatest things we achieve. This negation is therefore hugely creative.

      And one answer to the problem raised for free will by Libet’s experiments is that there is time between the unconscious initiation of an action and its execution for the conscious mind to intervene and ‘veto’ the action. In this sense, it may exert its influence more as ‘free won’t’ than ‘free will’.92

      Here is Schlegel again: ‘Where philosophy stops, poetry has to begin … Whatever can be done while poetry and philosophy are separated has been done and accomplished. So the time has come to unite the two.’

      ‘Everything’, he wrote (with characteristic impenetrability) ‘depends on the unity of differentiatedness and non-differentiatedness, or the identity of identity and non-identity.’101

      The polarity between the ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ points of view is a creation of the left hemisphere’s analytic disposition. In reality there can be neither absolutely, only a choice between a betweenness which acknowledges itself, and one which denies its own nature.

      Ramachandran carried out an experiment in which a patient with denial of a left arm paralysis received an injection of harmless salt water that she was told would ‘paralyse’ her (in reality already paralysed) left arm. Once her left hemisphere had someone else to blame for it, it was prepared to accept the existence of the paralysis.68

      Kant also, it may be noted, remained single, and died probably a virgin.

      Perhaps the single most important one is what Sass calls hyperconsciousness. Elements of the self and of experience which normally remain, and need to remain, intuitive, unconscious, become the objects of a detached, alienating attention; and levels of consciousness multiply, so that there is an awareness of one’s own awareness, and so on.

      This community attracted medical attention in the 1940s because of a mysterious anomaly: here was a rate of heart attack less than half the national average, despite having higher than average risk factors. After

      This is because philosophy does not answer our questions but shakes our belief that there are answers to be had; and in doing so it forces us to look beyond its own system to another way of understanding

#### Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 12 (Jung, C. G.)
      The demand made by the imitatio Christi—that we should follow the ideal and seek to become like it—ought logically to have the result of developing and exalting the inner man. In actual fact, however, the ideal has been turned by superficial and formalistically-minded believers into an external object of worship, and it is precisely this veneration for the object that prevents it from reaching down into the depths of the psyche and giving the latter a wholeness in keeping with the ideal.

      So long as religion is only faith and outward form, and the religious function is not experienced in our own souls, nothing of any importance has happened.

      “One becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third comes the one as the fourth.”

      The patient must be alone if he is to find out what it is that supports him when he can no longer support himself. Only this experience can give him an indestructible foundation.

      People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own souls.

      We can easily translate these ideas into the concretism of Freudian theory: the temenos would then be the womb of the mother and the rite a regression to incest. But these are the neurotic misunderstandings of people who have remained partly infantile and who do not realize that such things have been practised since time immemorial by adults whose activities cannot possibly be explained as a mere regression to infantilism. Otherwise the highest and most important achievements of mankind would ultimately be nothing but the perverted wishes of children, and the word “childish” would have lost its raison d’être.

      An inflated consciousness is always egocentric and conscious of nothing but its own existence. It is incapable of learning from the past, incapable of understanding contemporary events, and incapable of drawing right conclusions about the future.

#### The Nag Hammadi Scriptures (Meyer, Marvin W.;Robinson, James M.)
      Jesus of infinite sweetness.17

      For the Father’s children [34] are his fragrance; they are from the beauty of his face. The Father loves his fragrance and disperses it everywhere,

      Sometimes the evil order begins, in a foolish fashion, to work some evil, and the <wise> order emulates it in the shape of a malefactor, it too doing evil as if it were a power of evil. At other times the wise order sets out to do good, and the <foolish> order emulates it so as to do the same.

      The first ruler defiled Eve and produced in her two sons, a first and a second: Elohim and Yahweh.

      (1) Jesus said, “Whoever blasphemes against the Father will be forgiven, (2) and whoever blasphemes against the Son will be forgiven, (3) but whoever blasphemes against the holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either on earth or in heaven.”

      Jesus said, “I shall destroy [this] house, and no one will be able to build it [again].”

      (1) Jesus said, “I am the light that is over all things.144 I am all: from me all has come forth, and to me all has reached.145 (2) Split a piece of wood; I am there. (3) Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.”

      Jesus said, “The Father’s kingdom is like a person who wanted to put someone powerful to death. (2) While at home he drew his sword and thrust it into the wall to find out whether his hand would go in. (3) Then he killed the powerful one.”

      (1) “Whoever does not hate [father] and mother as I do cannot be a [disciple] of me, (2) and whoever does [not] love [father and] mother as I do cannot be a [disciple of] me. (3) For my mother [gave me [50] falsehood],176 but my true [mother]177 gave me life.”

      “If you wish to see the nature of this mystery,2 consider the marvelous image of sexual intercourse between male and female. For when the male reaches his climax, the semen is ejaculated. At that moment the female receives the strength of the male and the male receives the strength of the female, as the semen does this.

      The winds, which are demons from water, fire, darkness, and light, had intercourse unto perdition. Through their intercourse the winds received in their womb foam from the penis of the demons, and they conceived a power in their vulva through inhalation.

      Moses was a joke, called a faithful servant51 and friend.52 The testimony about him was wrong, since he never knew me. He did not know me, and none of those before him, from Adam to Moses and John the Baptizer, knew me or [64] my siblings. They had instruction from angels to observe food laws and submit to bitter slavery. They never knew truth and they never will, because their souls are enslaved and they can never find a mind with freedom to know, until they come to know the Son of Humanity. On account of my Father, I was the one the world did not know, and for this reason it rose up against me and my siblings. But we are blameless toward it; we have not sinned.

      In addition, I will say something more important. The mind, in terms of its actual being, is in a place, which means it is in the body. But in terms of the thought process, the mind is not in a place. For how can it be in a place when it contemplates every place?

      Entrust yourself to God alone, both as father and as friend. For everyone goes about in deceit. The whole earth is full of suffering and pain, things in which there is no profit. If you wish to lead your life in tranquility, do not keep company with anyone. Even if you do keep company with them, be as if you do not. Be pleasing to God, and you will not need anyone.

      For he168 it is who dwells in every place and in no place. For no one who wants to can know God as he is,169 not even Christ or the Spirit, or the chorus of angels, or the archangels [117], together with the thrones of the spirits, and exalted lordships, and the “great mind.”170 If you do not know yourself,171 you will not be able to know any of these.

      Put all words to the test before you utter them.

      The upward progression from Autogenes to Protophanes to Kalyptos is the progression from sequential discursive thought, to a simultaneous union of knowing subject and known object, to the total awareness or direct intuition of pure being.

      One person got sick and went to see the doctor. The latter examined him and wrote out a prescription. When the patient returned home, he placed the doctor’s portrait in the most conspicuous place, bowed to the portrait three times, lit an incense, took out the prescription, and solemnly began to chant, “Two pills in the morning! Two pills tonight!”

      THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS, HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW–GIVERS; they say: "Thus SHALL it be!" They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all subjugators of the past—they grasp at the future with a creative hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an instrument, and a hammer. Their "knowing" is CREATING, their creating is a law–giving, their will to truth is—WILL TO POWER.—Are there at present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers?

#### The Kyoto School (Carter, Robert E.)
      He simplified his approach when he wrote that the Western cultures are cultures of being, while Eastern cultures are cultures of nothingness

      “To experience means to know facts just as they are, to know in accordance with facts by completely relinquishing one's own fabrications. What we usually refer to as experience is adulterated with some sort of thought, so by pure I am referring to the state of experience just as it is without the least addition of deliberative discrimination

      Greek logos, like the Japanese morotomo, is “to gather,” or to be together with someone or something, as with a friend.

      “I think that we can distinguish the West to have considered being as the ground of reality, the East to have taken nothingness as its ground.

      Nothingness is that undivided something out of which God arises.

      “to exist while being absolutely nothing is the ultimate self-contradiction.”

      “In mediating the absolute through metanoetic confession of its own finitude and powerlessness, the relative ethical subject cooperates to make manifest the absolute nothingness of religion. Religion mediates itself to ethics through metanoesis in order to actualize an absolute mediation of the absolute-qua-relative. Metanoesis is both the gate through which ethics passes over into religion and the axis around which religion converts to ethics.”

      Nishitani which describes this kind of existential despair: “My life as a young man can be described in a single phrase: it was a period absolutely without hope…. My life at the time lay entirely in the grips of nihility and despair…. My decision, then, to study philosophy was in fact—melodramatic as it might sound—a matter of life and death.”

      “What I am talking about is the point at which the nihility that lies hidden as a reality at the ground of the self and all things makes itself present as a reality to the self in such a way that self-existence, together with the being of all things, turns into a single doubt.”

#### The Myth of Sisyphus (Vintage International) (Camus, Albert)
      THERE is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide.

      Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering.

      is one of analysis and not of knowledge. For methods imply metaphysics; unconsciously they disclose conclusions that they often claim not to know yet.

      Between the certainty I have of my existence and the content I try to give to that assurance, the gap will never be filled. Forever I shall be a stranger to myself. In psychology as in logic, there are truths but no truth. Socrates’ “Know thyself” has as much value as the “Be virtuous” of our confessionals.

      Kierkegaard was swallowed up in his God; Parmenides plunged thought into the One. But here thought hurls itself into an abstract polytheism

      At this point the problem is reversed. It was previously a question of finding out whether or not life had to have a meaning to be lived. It now becomes clear, on the contrary, that it will be lived all the better if it has no meaning. Living an experience, a particular fate, is accepting it fully.

      Thus I draw from the absurd three consequences, which are my revolt, my freedom, and my passion. By the mere activity of consciousness I transform into a rule of life what was an invitation to death—and I refuse suicide.

      Even though she was very tired, and seemed to be growing so young that she could scarcely hop, she carried on with her journey. Eventually she ran out of land entirely, and began to swim. This was lucky for her, because her own legs had completely shrunk away, and

      only her tail remained. Despite how far back she had come the frog-people still greeted her, laughing more than before, which was really later, or so it seemed to her then. She became so perplexed by the age of the frog-people that she called out to them: “Tell me, why are you here already, in this endless sea, with no land to hop on, or air to croak with, it makes no sense to me at all!” The frog-people continued to laugh, and pointed into the distance, where a figure was approaching from the other side. It was Bubbamu herself – grown astonishingly old – carrying as many frog-people as she could bear. ‘What a childish trick to play on myself’ she thought. ‘I must have travelled around the whole of time the other way, bringing the frog people with me. Why don’t I ever learn!?’ Bubbamu was so old by then, and also so young, that she died and was unborn at the same time, and for a moment there were only the frog-people. At least, that is what the frog-people have always said.

      During his lifetime, Bankei encountered criticism and opposition. He says, ‘When I was young and first began to declare the Unborn dharma, people had trouble understanding it.

      koan is something that from the outside has no solution, but from the inside is no problem.

      Imagery of this nature can be found throughout the world’s mystical traditions. In one of his sermons, the Christian mystic Meister Eckhart writes: I once had a dream. I dreamt that I, even though a man, was pregnant; pregnant and full with Nothingness, like a woman is with child. And that out of this Nothingness, God was born… The being and the nature of God are mine… What good is it to me for the Creator to give birth to his Son if I also do not give birth to him in my time and my culture?2

      A man needs to draw this energy down and store it in the space below the navel, in the kikai tanden.

He will realise that he himself is older than heaven and earth, deathless as space. This is true alchemy.

      The famous Zen text, the Mumonkan (The Gateless Gate), says: ‘All the illusory ideas and delusive thoughts accumulated up to the present will be exterminated, and when the time comes, internal and external will be spontaneously united.

If you die of starvation, you will suffer all the starvation there has been or will be. If ten thousand people die with you, their participation in your lot will not make you be ten thousand times more hungry nor multiply the time of your agony ten thousand times. Do not let yourself be overcome by the horrible sum of human sufferings; such a sum does not exist. Neither poverty nor pain are cumulative.”

      Our destiny (in contrast to Swedenborg's hell and the hell of Tibetan mythology) is not frightful because it is unreal; it is frightful because it is irreversible and ironbound. Time is the substance of which I am made. Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which mangles me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire. The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges.

      I sensed that the work was making mock of me. I sensed that Averroës, striving to imagine a drama without ever having suspected what a theater was, was no more absurd than I, who strove to imagine Averroës with no material other than some fragments from Renan, Lane, and Asín Palacios.

      I sensed, on the last page, that my narrative was a symbol of the man I was while I wrote it, and that to write that story I had to be that man, and that to be that man I had to write that story, and so to infinity. (The instant I stop believing in him, “Averroës” disappears.)

      I am not, either. I dreamed the world the way you dreamed your work, my Shakespeare: one of the forms of my dream was you, who, like me, are many and no one.

      What forces are we unable to sense that nonetheless influence our existence? Is it possible for us to become aware of these forces? And, perhaps most terribly, what do these forces intend for us?

At the end of each episode, another student would go crazy and end up killing themselves or someone else. The colors, like burning photographs, made me want to live in that world forever.

#### Liber Null & Psychonaut (Weiser Classics Series) (Carroll, Peter J.)
      Two major themes run through this book: that altered states of consciousness are the key to unlocking one's magical abilities; and that these abilities can be developed without any symbolic system except reality itself.

      Magic is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.

      Even a slight ability to change oneself is more valuable than any power over the external universe.

      To proceed, select any minor habit at random and delete it from your behavior; at the same time, adopt any new habit at random. The choices should not involve anything of spiritual, egocentric, or emotional significance, nor should you select anything with any possibility of failure. By persisting with such simple beginnings, you become capable of virtually anything.

      The “thing” responsible for the origin and continued action of events is called chaos by magicians. It could as well be called God or Tao, but the name “Chaos” is virtually meaningless, and free from the childish, anthropomorphic ideas of religion.

      It is a mistake to consider any belief more liberated than another. It is the possibility of change which is important. Every new form of liberation is destined to eventually become another form of enslavement for most of its adherents. There is no freedom from duality on this plane of existence, but one may at least aspire to choose duality.

      Liberating behavior is that which increases one's possibilities for future action. Limiting behavior is that which tends to narrow one's options. The secret of freedom is not to be drawn into situations where one's number of alternatives becomes limited or even unitary.

      In argument, always disagree, especially if your opponent begins to voice your own opinions.

      The only clear view is from atop the mountain of your dead selves.

      Those who self-righteously value their own contradictions are mighty on this earth.

      Science has brought us power and ideas but not the wisdom or responsibility to handle them.

      The chaotic aspect of new aeon magic is psychological anarchy. It is a species of operation mindfuck applied to ourselves as much as the world. The aim is to produce inspiration and enlightenment through disordering our belief structures. Humor, random belief, counter-information, and disinformation are its techniques.

#### Code That Fits in Your Head (Seemann, Mark)
      As the science-fiction author William Gibson said: “The future is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed”9

      Checklists come in two forms: read-do and do-confirm [40]. With a read-do checklist, you read each item on the list and immediately perform the action before you move on to the next item. With a do-confirm checklist, you do all the things, and then you run through the checklist and confirm that you’ve done all the activities.

      A computer will only make decisions based on the information it’s instructed to consult. Your brain tends to jump to conclusions. What you see is all there is.

      You may know Test Doubles as mocks and stubs. Like the word unit test, there’s no consensus about what these words actually mean. I try to avoid them for that reason. For what it’s worth, the excellent book xUnit Test Patterns [66] offers clear definitions of those terms, but alas, no one uses them.

      Write code for readers. As Martin Fowler put it: “Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” [34]

#### Nietzsche and Other Buddhas: Philosophy after Comparative Philosophy (Wirth, Jason M.)
      Nietzsche did not just transform the stock of philosophical concepts. He transformed both what could count as a philosophical concept and the manner in which concepts matter.

      This vertical dimension is what the early Nishida Kitarō called junsui keiken, pure experience. This is not the experience of something but rather experience before it divides into an experiencing subject and an experienced object. It is to “see” (beyond seer and seen) the formless form and to “hear” (beyond auditor and audited) the soundless sound.

      More to the point: What does the opening of the true Dharma eye, the special transmission outside of the scriptures that does not rest on words or letters, to turn a sutra into a Dharma eyeball, have to do with comparative philosophy? This is the question that ultimately guides this book.

      It is not virtue that makes us happy but rather happiness that makes us virtuous.

      I reached the end of reason, reached the limit of words, reached the end of all human skill or ability. Ordinary mental processes, consciousness, and emotions all ceased to function. It was as though I was encased in a sheet of ice ten thousand feet thick or sitting inside a bottle of pure crystal. My breath itself seemed to hang suspended. Then, in the middle of the night, a wonderful thing happened. As the sound of a distant bell reached my ears, I suddenly broke through into great enlightenment. It was mind and body falling away; fallen away mind and body. . . . The great earth completely and utterly vanished. Not a particle remained. (HP, 25–26)

      “Emptiness misunderstood destroys the slow-witted, like a serpent wrongly held or a spell wrongly executed

      Japan had imported a dead god without importing the critical awareness of its demise.

#### Anansi Boys (Gaiman, Neil)
      “There are three things, and three things only, that can lift the pain of mortality and ease the ravages of life,” said Spider. “These things are wine, women and song.” “Curry’s nice too,” pointed out Fat Charlie, but nobody was listening to him.

      Fat Charlie was thirsty and his head hurt and his mouth tasted evil and his eyes were too tight in his head and all his teeth twinged and his stomach burned and his back was aching in a way that started around his knees and went up to his forehead and his brains had been removed and replaced with cotton balls and needles and pins which was why it hurt to try and think, and his eyes were not just too tight in his head but they must have rolled out in the night and been reattached with roofing nails; and now he noticed that anything louder than the gentle Brownian motion of air molecules drifting softly past each other was above his pain threshold. Also, he wished he were dead.

      “The meaning of life is the hot blood of your prey on your tongue, the meat that rends beneath your teeth, the corpse of your enemy left in the sun for the carrion eaters to finish. That is what life is. I am Tiger, and I am stronger than Anansi ever was, bigger, more dangerous, more powerful, crueler, wiser….”

      He was having second thoughts about all this, something Spider found fairly disconcerting. Normally he didn’t even have first thoughts about things. Life without thinking had been perfectly pleasant

      Nothing happened. Nothing continued to happen. More Nothing. The Return of Nothing. Son of Nothing. Nothing Rides Again. Nothing and Abbott and Costello meet the Wolfman….

      Ah well, she thought. Being dead is probably just like everything else in life: you pick some of it up as you go along, and you just make up the rest.

      Spider venom comes in many forms. It can often take a long while to discover the full effects of the bite. Naturalists have pondered this for years: there are spiders whose bite can cause the place bitten to rot and to die, sometimes more than a year after it was bitten. As to why spiders do this, the answer is simple. It’s because spiders think this is funny, and they don’t want you ever to forget them.

      Charlie said, “Me too. I figured even if there was a nuclear war, it would still leave radioactive cockroaches and your mum.”

      Daisy looked up at him with the kind of expression that Jesus might have given someone who had just explained that he was probably allergic to bread and fishes, so could He possibly do him a quick chicken salad: there was pity in that expression, along with almost infinite compassion.

#### The Embodied Mind, revised edition (Varela, Francisco J.)
      Biology and cognitive science were arriving at the same idea—that human cognition is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by a separate mind or self, but instead the bringing forth or enacting of a dependent world of relevance in and through embodied action.

      Although it may seem as if there is a single, abiding self that functions as the controller of the mind, cognitive science indicates that what we call “the mind” is a collection of constantly changing, emergent processes that arise within a complex system comprising the brain, the rest of the body, and the physical and social environment, and in which we find no single, abiding, and controlling self.

      The core idea of enaction is that the living body is a self-organizing system.

      Survival means that the organism must preserve the integrity of its boundaries while having constant interchange with the environment.

      We hold with Merleau-Ponty that Western scientific culture requires that we see our bodies both as physical structures and as lived, experiential structures—in short, as both “outer” and “inner,” biological and phenomenological.

      embodiment has this double sense: it encompasses both the body as a lived, experiential structure and the body as the context or milieu of cognitive mechanisms.

      “You enter the brain through the eye, march up the optic nerve, round and round the cortex, looking behind every neuron, and then before you know it, you emerge into daylight on the spike of a motor nerve impulse, scratching your head and wondering where the self is.”

      This undercurrent of restlessness, grasping, anxiety, and unsatisfactoriness that pervades experience is called Dukkha, usually translated as suffering.

      The tension between the ongoing sense of self in ordinary experience and the failure to find that self in reflection is of central importance in Buddhism—the origin of human suffering is just this tendency to grasp onto and build a sense of self, an ego, where there is none.

      We now turn to some of the categories in the Buddhist teachings called the Abhidharma.5 This term refers to a collection of texts that forms one of the three divisions of the Buddhist canon (the other two are the Vinaya, which contains ethical precepts, and the Sutras, which contain the speeches of the Buddha).

      How is it, if we have no self, that there is coherence in our lives? How is it, if we have no self, that we continue to think, feel, and act as though we had a self—endlessly seeking to enhance and defend that nonfindable, nonexperienced self?

      Sanskrit word pratityasamutpada, which literally means “dependence (pratitya) upon conditions that are variously originated (samutpada).”

      operation of the entire cyclic system. The historical formation of various patterns and trends in our lives is what Buddhists usually mean by karma. It is this accumulation that gives continuity to the sense of ego-self, so evident in everyday, unreflective life.

      Strictly speaking, though, karma is the very process of intention (volitional action) itself, the main condition in the accumulation of conditioned human experience.

      Tibetan scholar Geshe Rabten puts it thus: “The term ‘primary mind’ denotes the totality of a sensory or mental state composed of a variety of mental factors. A primary mind is like a hand whereas the mental factors are like the individual fingers, the palm, and so forth. The character of a primary mind is thus determined by its constituent mental factors.”

      Ego-self, then, is the historical pattern among moment-to-moment emergent formations.

      By nihilism we mean to refer precisely to Nietzsche’s definition: “Radical nihilism is the conviction of an absolute untenability of existence when it comes to the highest values that one recognizes.”30 In other words, the nihilistic predicament is

      What, then, is Minsky’s response to this predicament? The final paragraph of his second-to-last page is worth quoting in full: No matter that the physical world provides no room for freedom of the will: that concept is essential to our model of the mental realm. Too much of our psychology is based on it for us to ever give it up. We’re virtually forced to maintain that belief, even though we know it’s false—except, of course when we’re inspired to find the flaws in all our beliefs, whatever may be the consequence to cheerfulness and mental peace.

      Why are processes so hard to classify? In earlier times, we could usually judge machines and processes by how they transformed raw materials into finished products. But it makes no sense to speak of brains as though they manufacture thoughts the way factories make cars. The difference is that brains use processes that change themselves—and this means we cannot separate such processes from the products they produce. In particular, brains make memories, which change the ways we’ll subsequently think. The principal activities of brains are making changes in themselves. Because the whole idea of self-modifying processes is new to our experience, we cannot yet trust our commonsense judgement about such matters.8

      A system that has operational closure is one in which the results of its processes are those processes themselves.

      The key point is that such systems do not operate by representation. Instead of representing an independent world, they enact a world as a domain of distinctions that is inseparable from the structure embodied by the cognitive system.

      By progressively learning to let go of these tendencies to grasp, one can begin to appreciate that all phenomena are free of any absolute ground and that such “groundlessness” (sunyata) is the very fabric of dependent coorigination. We could make a somewhat similar point phenomenologically by saying that groundlessness is the very condition for the richly textured and interdependent world of human experience.

      The term hermeneutics originally referred to the discipline of interpreting ancient texts, but it has been extended to denote the entire phenomenon of interpretation, understood as the enactment or bringing forth of meaning from a background of understanding.

      Meaning includes patterns of embodied experience and preconceptual structures of our sensibility (i.e., our mode of perception, or orienting ourselves, and of interacting with other objects, events, or persons). These embodied patterns do not remain private or peculiar to the person who experiences them.

      Why does color have this structure? Why, for example, are hues organized into pairs that are mutually exclusive or opponent? The model of color vision that takes as its point of departure the structure of color appearance, and so attempts to answer these questions, is known as the opponent-process theory. This theory owes its origin to the research of the nineteenth-century physiologist Ewald Hering but was proposed in its modern form by Leo Hurvich and Dorothea Jameson in 1957.

      Thus color categories appear to be a panhuman, species-specific universal.

      Chicken position: The world out there has pregiven properties. These exist prior to the image that is cast on the cognitive system, whose task is to recover them appropriately (whether through symbols or global subsymbolic states).

      Egg position: The cognitive system projects its own world, and the apparent reality of this world is merely a reflection of internal laws of the system.

      Let us explain what we mean by this phrase embodied action. By using the term embodied we mean to highlight two points: first, that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individual sensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological, psychological, and cultural context.43 By using the term action we mean to emphasize once again that sensory and motor processes, perception and action, are fundamentally inseparable in lived cognition. Indeed, the two are not merely contingently linked in individuals; they have also evolved together.

      We can now give a preliminary formulation of what we mean by enaction. In a nutshell, the enactive approach consists of two points: (1) perception consists in perceptually guided action and (2) cognitive structures emerge from the recurrent sensorimotor patterns that enable action to be perceptually guided.

      “The environment (Umwelt) emerges from the world through the actualization or the being of the organism—[granted that] an organism can exist only if it succeeds in finding in the world an adequate environment.”

      Meaningful conceptual structures arise from two sources: (1) from the structured nature of bodily and social experience and (2) from our innate capacity to imaginatively project from certain well-structured aspects of bodily and interactional experience to abstract conceptual structures. Rational thought is the application of very general cognitive processes—focusing, scanning, superimposition, figure-ground reversal, etc.—to such structures.59

      A view of psychopathology fundamentally different from either the Freudian approach or object relations theory was offered by Karl Jaspers, Ludwig Binswagner, and Merleau-Ponty based on the philosophy of Heidegger.

#### The Gateless Gate: The Classic Book of Zen Koans (Yamada, Kōun)
      The entrance into Zen is the grasping of one’s essential nature. It is absolutely impossible, however, to come to a clear understanding of our essential nature by any intellectual or philosophical method. It is accomplished only by the experience of self-realization through zazen.

      It is related that the bodhisattva Manjusri was once standing at the gate, and seeing him, Shakyamuni Buddha called to him, “Manju, Manju, why don’t you come inside the gate?” Manjusri replied, “I don’t see anything outside the gate.”

      For unenlightened people, every koan is a barrier. For the enlightened person, however, there is no gate, no barrier at all. This is because the essential world is totally void. We cannot see anything there. There is neither gate nor barrier, and so-called enlightened people are those who have realized this fact.

      Mu has no meaning whatsoever. If you want to solve the problem of Mu, you must become one with it! You must forget yourself in working on it. Your consciousness must be completely absorbed in your practice of Mu.

      Mumon says, “It will be just as if you had snatched the great sword of General Kan: If you meet a Buddha, you will kill him. If you meet a patriarch, you will kill him. Though you may stand on the brink of life and death, you will enjoy the great freedom. In the six realms and the four modes of birth, you will live in the samadhi of innocent play.”

      turning word (tengo) is a word or phrase which has the power to turn delusions into enlightenment.

      There is an ancient Zen text called Believing in Mind (Shinjin-Mei), in which the line appears: “One is everything. Everything is one.”

      What is a fact in Zen? It is the manifestation of essential nature by an action such as standing up, sitting down, eating, drinking, crying, or laughing. In the case of Jōshū’s Mu, Mu is the fact. In the case of Gutei’s finger, raising a finger is the fact. In this case, the fact is some action of the man in the tree.

      You may ask why our essential nature is empty. Just consider what we call our mind or consciousness. Does it have any form? No. Any color? No. Any length or breadth or weight? No. Can we locate it? No, we do not know where it is. The mind has nothing. The mind is nothing. It is void and empty, and our essential nature is nothing but the boundless extension or manifestation of this ordinary mind of ours.

      While being empty, our mind has, at the same time, limitless and infinite capabilities or activities. It can see, it can hear, it can stand up, it can sit down, it can take a walk. It can feel, it can think, it can imagine, it can forget. Though void, it is limitless and infinite. Therefore, I call it the empty-infinite or the empty-limitlessness, and this is our essential nature. This constitutes the denominator of the fraction. The phenomenal world is the numerator.

      In contemplating the empty-infinite, Buddhism has two approaches, one called Hinayana and the other Mahayana. The Hinayana way is to understand that everything is empty by means of analysis. The Mahayana way is to realize that everything is substantially void by means of experience.

      One of the sutras defines a kalpa as the period of time it would take an angel who descended from heaven once every hundred years and made one sweep with its robe of feathers across the top of a cubic-mile stone mountain to wear it down level to the ground.

#### Alice in Wonderland Collection – All Four Books: Alice in Wonderland, Alice Through the Looking Glass, Hunting of the Snark and Alice Underground (Illustrated) (Carroll, Lewis)
      For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.

      She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),

      Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.

      "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"

      turning to Alice. 'Only a thimble,'

      'Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him when he sneezes: He only does it to annoy, Because he knows it teases.' CHORUS. (In which the cook and the baby joined):— 'Wow! wow! wow!'

      'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.'

      'In that direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and in that direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.' 'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked. 'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.' 'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice. 'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'

      'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'

      'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't take more.' 'You mean you can't take less,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take more than nothing.'

      "Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'

      'Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!'

      The Red Queen shook her head, 'You may call it "nonsense" if you like,' she said, 'but I've heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!'

      'A slow sort of country!' said the Queen. 'Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!'

      Alice thought to herself, 'Then there's no use in speaking.' The voices didn't join in this time, as she hadn't spoken, but to her great surprise, they all thought in chorus (I hope you understand what thinking in chorus means—for I must confess that I don't), 'Better say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!'

      "The time has come," the Walrus said, "To talk of many things: Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax— Of cabbages—and kings— And why the sea is boiling hot— And whether pigs have wings."

      'I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes the shawl again!'

      'Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall: Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King's horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.'

      'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.'

      'Or else it doesn't, you know. The name of the song is called "Haddocks' Eyes."' 'Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?' Alice said, trying to feel interested. 'No, you don't understand,' the Knight said, looking a little vexed. 'That's what the name is called. The name really is "The Aged Man."' 'Then I ought to have said "That's what the song is called"?' Alice corrected herself. 'No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing! The song is called "Ways and Means": but that's only what it's called, you know!' 'Well, what IS the song, then?' said Alice, who was by this time completely bewildered. 'I was coming to that,' the Knight said. 'The song really is "A-Sitting on a Gate": and the tune's my own invention.'

      "I said it in Hebrew—I said it in Dutch— I said it in German and Greek: But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much) That English is what you speak!"

      They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; They pursued it with forks and hope; They threatened its life with a railway-share; They charmed it with smiles and soap.

      For every 25 percent increase in problem complexity, there is a 100 percent increase in complexity of the software solution. That’s not a condition to try to change (even though reducing complexity is always a desirable thing to do); that’s just the way it is.

      What constituted an error of omitted logic? Such things as the failure to reset a data item to its original value after it had been used but was needed again and conditional statements with one or more conditions left out—the kinds of things that resulted from coders and designers not thinking sufficiently deeply about the problem they were addressing.

      Software that a typical programmer believes to be thoroughly tested has often had only about 55 to 60 percent of its logic paths executed. Using automated support, such as coverage analyzers, can raise that roughly to 85 to 90 percent. It is nearly impossible to test software at the level of 100 percent of its logic paths.

      Even if 100 percent test coverage were possible, that is not a sufficient criterion for testing. Roughly 35 percent of software defects emerge from missing logic paths, and another 40 percent from the execution of a unique combination of logic paths. They will not be caught by 100 percent coverage.

      Old hardware becomes obsolete; old software goes into production every night.

      The 60/60 rule: 60 percent of software’s dollar is spent on maintenance, and 60 percent of that maintenance is enhancement. Enhancing old software is, therefore, a big deal.

      “[T]he best way to prepare [to be a programmer] is to write programs and to study great programs that other people have written . . .. I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I fished out listings of their operating systems.”

      Quality is an elusive term. And it is especially elusive in the software field. The elusiveness of the term is the primary focus of that wonderful book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (Pirsig 1974). The main character of the book, an academic looking into the real meaning of the word, went mad seeking a workable definition!

      The computer science field, which is stuck teaching writing programs before reading them, knowing that is wrong but doesn’t seem to know how to fix it.

      There are sure a lot of people in the software world who would like to believe that one size fits all. Those selling methodologies. Those defining process approaches. Those pushing tools and techniques. Those hoping to build component-based software. Those setting standards. Those doing research toward the next software engineering holy grail. Those academics who put the prefix meta- in front of whatever they’re working on. All of them are seeking that “universal software elixir.” Many of them even believe they have found it. All too many of them want to sell it to you!

      Reality is the murder of a beautiful theory by a gang of ugly facts.

#### Fight Club: A Novel (Palahniuk, Chuck)
      The three ways to make napalm: One, you can mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate. Two, you can mix equal parts of gasoline and diet cola. Three, you can dissolve crumbled cat litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.

      We have sort of a triangle thing going here. I want Tyler. Tyler wants Marla. Marla wants me. I don’t want Marla, and Tyler doesn’t want me around, not anymore. This isn’t about love as in caring. This is about property as in ownership.

      I had to know what Tyler was doing while I was asleep. If I could wake up in a different place, at a different time, could I wake up as a different person?

      One minute was enough, Tyler said, a person had to work hard for it, but a minute of perfection was worth the effort. A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.

      Then you’re trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.

      The phone rang in Tyler’s rented house on Paper Street.

      "If you don’t know what you want,” the doorman said, "you end up with a lot you don’t.”

      May I never be complete. May I never be content. May I never be perfect. Deliver me, Tyler, from being perfect and complete.

      Sometimes, Tyler speaks for me.

      At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves.

      I’m starting to wonder if Tyler and Marla are the same person. Except for their humping, every night in

      Tyler and Marla are never in the same room. I never see them together.

      I turn around, and Tyler’s appeared. Tyler says, "Did you get rid of her?” Not a sound, not a smell, Tyler’s just appeared

      "It’s only after you’ve lost everything,” Tyler says, "that you’re free to do anything.”

      "Where you’re at, now,” Tyler says, "you can’t even imagine what the bottom will be like.”

      The second Marla opens the screen door, Tyler is gone, vanished, run out of the room, disappeared.

      The moment Marla is out the door, Tyler appears back in the room. Fast as a magic trick. My parents did this magic act for five years.

      "Don’t ever talk to her about me. Don’t talk about me behind my back. Do you promise?” Tyler says. I promise.

      shining wet kiss on the back of my hand. "This is a chemical burn,” Tyler says, "and it will hurt worse than you’ve ever been burned. Worse than a hundred cigarettes.”

      That was Tyler’s first mission as a service industry terrorist. Guerrilla waiter. Minimum-wage despoiler. Tyler’s been doing this for years, but he says everything is more fun as a shared activity.

      What you have to know is that Marla is still alive. Marla’s philosophy of life, she told me, is that she can die at any moment. The tragedy of her life is that she doesn’t.

      Marla’s heart looked the way my face was. The crap and the trash of the world. Post-consumer human butt wipe that no one would ever go to the trouble to recycle.

      "When you’re twenty-four,” Marla says, "you have no idea how far you can really fall, but I was a fast learner.”

      "Disaster is a natural part of my evolution,” Tyler whispered, "toward tragedy and dissolution.”

      "I’m breaking my attachment to physical power and possessions,” Tyler whispered, "because only through destroying myself can I discover the greater power of my spirit.”

      "The liberator who destroys my property,” Tyler said, "is fighting to save my spirit. The teacher who clears all possessions from my path will set me free.”

      Arson meets on Monday. Assault on Tuesday. Mischief meets on Wednesday. And Misinformation meets on Thursday. Organized Chaos. The Bureaucracy of Anarchy. You figure it out. Support groups. Sort

      The goal was to teach each man in the project that he had the power to control history. We, each of us, can take control of the world.

      I wanted to burn the Louvre. I’d do the Elgin Marbles with a sledgehammer and wipe my ass with the Mona Lisa. This is my world, now.

      If you know where to look, there are bodies buried everywhere.

      "You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everyone else, and we are all part of the same compost pile.”

      telephone was ringing in my dream, and it’s not clear if reality slipped into my dream or if my dream is slopping over into reality.

      Here, I’m not sure if Tyler is my dream.

      "What you have to consider,” he says, "is the possibility that God doesn’t like you. Could be, God hates us. This is not the worst thing that can happen.”

      "Drunk Drivers Against Mothers.” "Recycle All the Animals.”

      "I Drive Better When I’m Drunk.”

      "You had a near-life experience,” the mechanic says.

      Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don’t really need.

      You didn’t say anything. Get out of here, and do your little life, but remember I’m watching you, Raymond Hessel, and I’d rather kill you than see you working a shit job for just enough money to buy cheese and watch television.

      This is what Tyler wants me to do. These are Tyler’s words coming out of my mouth. I am Tyler’s mouth. I am Tyler’s hands.

      Yeah, I say, it’s a test. Has he ever met Tyler Durden? "You stopped in last week, Mr. Durden,” he says. "Don’t you remember?” Tyler was here. "You were here, sir.” I’ve never been in here before tonight.

      "Every time you fall asleep,” Tyler says, "I run off and do something wild, something crazy, something completely out of my mind.”

      "There isn’t a me and a you, anymore,” Tyler says, and he pinches the end of my nose. "I think you’ve figured that out.”

      "We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we’ll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won’t. And we’re just learning this fact,” Tyler said. "So don’t fuck with us.”

      "And the jobs, well, why do you think you’re so tired. Geez, it’s not insomnia. As soon as you fall asleep, I take over and go to work or fight club or whatever. You’re lucky I didn’t get a job as a snake handler.”

      "Just like Tony Perkins’ mother in Psycho,” Marla says. "This is so cool. Everybody has their little quirks. One time, I dated a guy who couldn’t get enough body piercings.”

      THAT OLD SAYING, about how you always kill the thing you love, well, it works both ways. And it does work both ways.

      How everything you ever love will reject you or die. Everything you ever create will be thrown away. Everything you’re proud of will end up as trash. I am Ozymandias, king of kings.

#### There Is No Antimemetics Division (qntm)
      Asynchronous research — whereby the research topic is forgotten entirely between iterations, and rediscovered over and over — is a perfectly standard practice in the Antimemetics Division,

      "SCP-3125 is a five-dimensional anomalous metastasized mass of bad memes and bad antimemes and everything in between, seeping through to our physical reality. It isn't coherent and it isn't intelligent. It can't communicate. This is an auditory hallucination."

      "When I first joined the Foundation, I asked my mentor, who retired many years ago, 'What's the biggest anomaly we've ever contained?' That he was cleared for, I meant, of course. And he told me about a very old rumor he once heard, back in his earliest days, when he was just starting out. The rumor was that Abrahamic religions had not always been monotheistic. Originally, there were three capital-G Gods. And sometime in the past hundred and fifty years, the Foundation had killed two of them.

#### TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) (R., Fall Kevin)
      Chunks coming from different sources or senders can be mixed together and pulled apart later, which is called multiplexing.

      In statistical multiplexing, traffic is mixed together based on the arrival statistics or timing pattern of the traffic.

      a datagram is a special type of packet in which all the identifying information of the source and final destination resides inside the packet itself (instead of in the packet switches).

      Fate sharing suggests placing all the necessary state to maintain an active communication association (e.g., virtual connection) at the same location with the communicating endpoints.

      The end-to-end argument tends to support a design with a “dumb” network and “smart” systems connected to the network

      With best-effort delivery, the network does not expend much effort to ensure that data is delivered without errors or gaps.

      With layering, each layer is responsible for a different facet of the communications.

      A router, by definition, has two or more network interfaces (because it connects two or more networks). Any system with multiple interfaces is called multihomed.

      There are three types of IP addresses, and the type affects how forwarding is performed: unicast (destined for a single host), broadcast (destined for all hosts on a given network), and multicast (destined for a set of hosts that belong to a multicast group).

      The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an adjunct to IP, and we label it as a layer 3.5 protocol.

      The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is another protocol adjunct to IPv4.

      Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP),

      Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP),

      This notion is the basis for the so-called Metcalfe’s Law, which states roughly that the value of a computer network is proportional to the square of the number of connected endpoints (e.g., users or devices).

#### Notes from the Underground (Fyodor Dostoevsky)
      Now, I am living out my life in my corner, taunting myself with the spiteful and useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot become anything seriously, and it is only the fool who becomes anything.

      but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one’s position.

      But of course that is because I do not respect myself. Can a man of perception respect himself at all?

      Come, can a man who attempts to find enjoyment in the very feeling of his own degradation possibly have a spark of respect for himself?

      Oh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should have respected myself, then. I should have respected myself because I should at least have been capable of being lazy;

      that is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason and advantage dictated.

      What man wants is simply INDEPENDENT choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice.

      fact, I believe that the best definition of man is the ungrateful biped.

      I answer for it, for the whole work of man really seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano-key!

      corporal punishment is better than nothing.

      I swear to you, gentlemen, there is not one thing, not one word of what I have written that I really believe. That is, I believe it, perhaps, but at the same time I feel and suspect that I am lying like a cobbler.

      It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments.

      Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave. That is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly

      Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment.

      I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you.

      Why is it strange? In the first place, by then I was incapable of love, for I repeat, with me loving meant tyrannising and showing my moral superiority. I have never in my life been able to imagine any other sort of love, and have nowadays come to the point of sometimes thinking that love really consists in the right— freely given by the beloved object—to tyrannise over her.

      And, indeed, I will ask on my own account here, an idle question: which is better—cheap happiness or exalted sufferings? Well, which is better?

#### THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE (ILLUSTRATED) (Nietzsche, Friedrich)
      "How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?—Even among the Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted."

      we may also say with Master Eckhardt: "The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering."

      Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things.

      The translation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, cause, end in itself, was HIS work.

      Zarathustra CREATED the most portentous error, MORALITY, consequently he should also be the first to PERCEIVE that error,

      Am I understood?... The overcoming of morality through itself—through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist through his opposite—THROUGH ME—: that is what the name Zarathustra means in my mouth."

      When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: "Could it be possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that GOD IS DEAD!"

      The hour when ye say: "What good is my pity! Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity is not a crucifixion."

      Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over an abyss. A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.

      I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.

      There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself. Lo! I show you THE LAST MAN.

      No shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.

      Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.

      To create new values—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the might of the lion do.

      Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea. Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth the world's outcast.

      The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.

      Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage—it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy body.

      Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.

      Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.

      Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit. It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.

      Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.

      Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward because I am exalted. Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities.

      Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive—so wisdom wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.

      I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.

      And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: he was the spirit of gravity—through him all things fall.

      By our best enemies we do not want to be spared, nor by those either whom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!

      Ye say it is the good cause which halloweth even war? I say unto you: it is the good war which halloweth every cause.

      Your highest thought, however, ye shall have it commanded unto you by me—and it is this: man is something that is to be surpassed.

      What warrior wisheth to be spared!

      A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: "I, the state, am the people."

      But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.

      Just see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour one another, and cannot even digest themselves.

      Ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne.—and ofttimes also the throne on filth.

      Slow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait until they know WHAT hath fallen into their depths.

      Flee into thy solitude! Thou hast lived too closely to the small and the pitiable. Flee from their invisible vengeance! Towards thee they have nothing but vengeance.

      Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the dreams of a lustful woman?

      Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in your instincts. Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with many almost a vice.

      One ought still to honour the enemy in one's friend. Canst thou go nigh unto thy friend, and not go over to him? In one's friend one shall have one's best enemy. Thou shalt be closest unto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him.

      Art thou a slave? Then thou canst not be a friend. Art thou a tyrant? Then thou canst not have friends. Far too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman. On that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knoweth only love.

      In woman's love there is injustice and blindness to all she doth not love. And even in woman's conscious love, there is still always surprise and lightning and night, along with the light. As yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats, and birds. Or at the best, cows.

      Fire of love gloweth in the names of all the virtues, and fire of wrath.

#### Software Performance Testing: Concepts, Design, and Analysis (Shen, JJ)
      Latency is less than or equal to the response time of a request, since the response time is what it takes to get a full response for a request, and it includes request processing time at the server-side. We will discuss more on latency and response time throughout the rest of the book.

      Bandwidth is the transmission capacity, while throughput is the actual amount of data transmitted in a unit of time for a specific case. So, bandwidth is the maximum throughput of a communication path.

      The major capacities or performance indicators are: (1)  Response time (2)  Throughput (3)  Number of concurrent users (4)  Resource utilization (5)  Stability (6)  Scalability Let’s discuss them one by one.

      Components Performance Impacting Factors Queueing               External: Browser # of requests to a particular server for an action Stalled/Blocked External: Network Network configuration DNS lookup          External: DNS service Connection time      External: Network Network latency Time to first byte     Internal: Software design;    Deployment architecture,  configuration & environment. External: Network Server processing speed; Server request load; Network latency Content download External: Network Network bandwidth

      We define effective maximum throughput as the effective capacity of the system.

      The next table summarizes these factors and the major impacted performance indicators, respectively.
