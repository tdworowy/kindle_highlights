#### Hoaxed: Everything They Told You is a Lie (Cernovich, Mike)
      To understand the media requires you to set aside logic and reasoning. Embrace the double standard.

      “I'm not going to let giant political decisions, involving billions or trillions of dollars and essential human freedoms, to be driven by pianos and sad eyes,”

      Piano is not an argument. People being sad is not an argument.

      There is no long-term future for fiat currency. There never has been, in the entire history of the world. All fiat currencies fail. The longest it's ever lasted is the British pound sterling — about 400 years. But it's lost ninety-eight percent of its value over that time. There is no long-term future for fiat currencies.

      I mean, it's a moving target. Doesn't matter. They just hate the free market. Because they can't compete in the free market. Because their sophists. And they're manipulators. And the one thing that is very true, in my experience, of people on the left: Nothing spells, “rational pragmatism,” like working with your hands once in your goddamn life. Work with your hands. Do you know how dangerous it has been? People don't grow their own food anymore. Try having a tantrum because your watermelon didn't grow. Try screaming at your tomato plants. “More tomatoes! I need them!” But, you can scream at the government. You can scream at guilty people and they'll give you resources so you'll shut up and go away. Try screaming at a cow — she'll just shit on your hand rather than give you milk.

      And so, the prestige is related to the power of the-, of the institution to change perception and behavior. Well, so it's-, it's-, it's the brand, so you could say the brand is the marker of that prestige that’s being stored up across time. Yeah.

      totalitarian states would not have been possible without the moral corruption of the individuals within that society.

      And if we don't reset the country and reset the social contract, we run the risk of — and, again, am I talking about a revolution — but we run the risk of turning the country into something different than what it was that we grew up in. I grew up in the opportunistic-, I grew up in the aspirational working class. The working class today is desperate. And so, the reason I'm doing it is I want to really help that, because the country's been so good to me.

      But Beren laughed. ‘For little price,’ he said, ‘do Elven-kings sell their daughters: for gems, and things made by craft. But if this be your will, Thingol, I will perform it. And when we meet again my hand shall hold a Silmaril from the Iron Crown; for you have not looked the last upon Beren son of Barahir.’

#### The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Kuhn, Thomas S.)
      Theories should be accurate in their predictions, consistent, broad in scope, present phenomena in an orderly and coherent way, and be fruitful in suggesting new phenomena or relationships between phenomena.

      Scientific fact and theory are not categorically separable, except perhaps within a single tradition of normal-scientific practice. That is why the unexpected discovery is not simply factual in its import and why the scientist’s world is qualitatively transformed as well as quantitatively enriched by fundamental novelties of either fact or theory.

      How could history of science fail to be a source of phenomena to which theories about knowledge may legitimately be asked to apply?

      “Truth emerges more readily from error than from confusion.”10

      These three classes of problems—determination of significant fact, matching of facts with theory, and articulation of theory—exhaust, I think, the literature of normal science, both empirical and theoretical.

      Paradigms may be prior to, more binding, and more complete than any set of rules for research that could be unequivocally abstracted from them.

      “A science that hesitates to forget its founders is lost.”

      Darwin, in a particularly perceptive passage at the end of his Origin of Species, wrote: “Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume . . . , I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. . . . [B]ut I look with confidence to the future,—to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality.”

Jeżeli na kamieniu narysujemy uśmiechniętą twarz, to będziemy mieli wrażenie, że ten kamień jest szczęśliwy. W odniesieniu do uczenia głębokiego oznacza to np., że jeżeli uda nam się wytrenować działający poprawnie model generujący podpisy rysunków, to może nam się wydać, że model „rozumie” to, co znajduje się na rysunku. W takim przypadku zostaniemy niemile zaskoczeni przez absurdalne opisy generowane przez model w odniesieniu do obrazów spoza treningowego zbioru danych (patrz rysunek 9.1).

#### Python for DevOps (Noah Gift, Kennedy Behrman, Alfredo Deza, and Grig Gheorghiu)
      Your curiosity and a never-ending pursuit of knowledge will continue to make you, and the environments you work on, much better.

      The same concept can be applied to Python, the language. Fully accepting the strengths and weaknesses of the language allows a developer to utilize it fully. Python is not a high-performance language. Python is not a language optimized for writing servers like other languages are: Go, Java, C, C++, C#, or Erlang. Instead, Python is a language for applying high-level logic on top of high-performance code written in a high-performance language or platform. Python is widely popular because

      the correct understanding of a matter and misunderstanding the matter are not mutually exclusive

      Collecting data to estimate the Gini over long periods of time is extremely difficult. Estimates in recent years, for example, depend a great deal on the information available in the records of the income-tax authorities. Most adults in the west now either pay tax on their income or receive income in the form of benefits from the state. Indeed, given the massive complications of most tax and benefit systems, many people both pay tax and receive benefits in one form or another. The point here is that reasonably reliable information now exists on the individual incomes of almost all adults. For most of history, and even for the history of the last two hundred years of industrial capitalism, this was not the case. State spending as a proportion of the overall economy was much lower, and so most people were not required to pay income tax.

      The Economist magazine reported in February 2003 that American schools were more segmented on racial lines than they were in the 1960s. And it was precisely in the 1960s that major initiatives began to be taken to improve integration and break down the old racial barriers.

      The rules of the Schelling game appear to be – and indeed are – simple, but they give rise to complex, and unanticipated, behaviour of the system.

      ‘There are four stages of acceptance: i) this is worthless nonsense; ii) this is an interesting, but perverse, point of view; iii) this is true, but quite unimportant; iv) I always said so.’

      In a purely economic context, firms can interact in ways which damage each other’s fitness for survival. They can, for example, become involved in a price war, the end result of which is simply to reduce each other’s profits. A less obvious example was the decision by the food superstores in Britain to open on Sundays some fifteen years ago. Legislation had made it possible for the first time, but the companies hesitated. Nevertheless, as soon as one began Sunday opening, the others were compelled to follow for fear of losing market share. However, the total sales passing through these stores did not increase as a result, for shoppers already had ample opportunity to visit the stores during the rest of the week. The consumers were happier, but all the companies themselves ended up incurring higher costs, through the extra wages paid on the Sunday, for example, with no increase in sales.

      For Hayek, ‘an economist who is only an economist cannot be a good economist’.

      In terms of the public policy implications, the authorities need to recognize that within a single industry co-operative relationships between firms are necessary for the fitness of the industry as whole. If competition is enforced too strongly, the overall fitness of the industry is reduced. But protection for the industry as a whole also tends to reduce overall fitness. Firms need an external environment which is competitive but require a certain level of co-operative behaviour between each other within the industry.

      Administering public policy is a far more complicated task, and the dimensions of the problem are even greater than those described by our models and games. Not surprisingly, the cast of mind which believes in detailed planning and monitoring usually fails.

#### Philosophical Investigations: Volume 85 (The Macat Library) (O' Sullivan, Michael)
      In epistemology, contextualism is the view that what counts as knowledge in one context may not count as knowledge in another. I may believe I know, for everyday purposes, that a colleague is trustworthy. But if I am a witness in a court of law, where higher standards of evidence are demanded, I may not count on knowing this. Wittgenstein put forward something like this view in his late work On Certainty, but it also has roots in Investigations.

      Richard Rorty (1931–2007) was an American philosopher. He was a radical critic of contemporary philosophical trends and wrote widely on literature as well as the philosophy of language.

#### Enterprise Continuous Testing: Transforming Testing for Agile and DevOps (Platz, Wolfgang)
      With risk coverage, the focus shifts from the number of requirements tested to the risk weight of the requirements tested. You can usually achieve much higher risk coverage by testing 10 critical requirements than you can by testing 100 more trivial ones.

      Simplify automation across the technology stack End the test maintenance nightmare Shift to API testing whenever feasible

      Test automation is perfect for repeatedly checking whether incremental application changes break your existing functionality. However, test automation falls short for determining if new functionality truly meets expectations. Does it address the business needs behind the user story? Does it do so in a way that’s easy to use, resource-efficient, reliable, and consistent with the rest of your application?

#### Explore It!: Reduce Risk and Increase Confidence with Exploratory Testing (Hendrickson, Elisabeth)
      “It is so frustrating,” she sighed. “No matter how many tests we write, no matter how many cases we execute, we always find the most serious bugs when we go off the script.”

      Your exploration has answered all the open questions, and you know of no more unknowns.  You are not learning anything new. You have characterized the capabilities, limitations, and risks of the existing implementation. As a result, you feel like you are dealing with a known quantity with no more surprises to be uncovered, at least for now.  More information will not change anything. You could gather more information, but there is no point. Your stakeholders have explicitly told you they do not need or want more information from exploring, and you know that no one will act on any information you find, including you.  Other information has more value. Perhaps you could find more information in a given area, but there are other, more pressing questions to address in other areas or on other charters.

      This is the essence of testing: designing an experiment to gather empirical evidence to answer a question about a risk.

#### Artificial Unintelligence (The MIT Press) (Broussard, Meredith)
      “All games of perfect information have an optimal value function, v*(s), which determines the outcome of the game, from every board position or state s, under perfect play by all players. These games may be solved by recursively computing the optimal value function in a search tree containing approximately bd possible sequences of moves, where b is the game’s breadth (number of legal moves per position) and d is its depth (game length).”

      It will seem difficult at first, but everything is difficult at first. Bows are difficult to draw, halberds are difficult to wield;

      You should not have a favourite weapon. To become over-familiar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well. You should not copy others, but use weapons which you can handle properly. It is bad for commanders and troopers to have likes and dislikes. These are things you must learn thoroughly.

#### Meditations (Inti Classics): by Marcus Aurelius (Aurelius, Marcus)
      Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.

      Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor the tranquility which others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept erect by others.

      The universe is transformation: life is opinion.

      Now, after months of delay, some due to an unexpectedly long debugging period (there has never been an unexpectedly short debugging period in the history of computers),

      It was there that Stewart Brand, hacker godfather and Whole Earth Catalog editor, hacked the “Information Should Be Free” principle. It’s worth citing his comment, uttered off the cuff at a session I hosted called “The Future of the Hacker Ethic,” because it’s so often misquoted. “On one hand, information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable,” Brand said. “The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.”

#### How Not to Be Wrong (Ellenberg, Jordan)
      Math is like an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.

      repeating decimal 0.99999… … equal to 1? I have seen people come nearly to blows over this question.* It’s hotly disputed on websites ranging from World of Warcraft fan pages to Ayn Rand forums.

      An important rule of mathematical hygiene: when you’re field-testing a mathematical method, try computing the same thing several different ways. If you get several different answers, something’s wrong with your method. For example: the 2004 bombings at the Atocha train

      What Sherlock Holmes should have said was: “It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth, unless the truth is a hypothesis it didn’t occur to you to consider.”

      Believe whatever you believe by day; but at night, argue against the propositions you hold most dear. Don’t cheat! To the greatest extent possible you have to think as though you believe what you don’t believe. And if you can’t talk yourself out of your existing beliefs, you’ll know a lot more about why you believe what you believe. You’ll have come a little closer to a proof.

      Every time you observe that more of a good thing is not always better; or you remember that improbable things happen a lot, given enough chances, and resist the lure of the Baltimore stockbroker; or you make a decision based not just on the most likely future, but on the cloud of all possible futures, with attention to which ones are likely and which ones are not; or you let go of the idea that the beliefs of groups should be subject to the same rules as beliefs of individuals; or, simply, you find that cognitive sweet spot where you can let your intuition run wild on the network of tracks formal reasoning makes for it; without writing down an equation or drawing a graph, you are doing mathematics, the extension of common sense by other means. When are you going to use it? You’ve been using mathematics since you were born and you’ll probably never stop. Use it well.

#### Practical Statistics for Data Scientists (Bruce, Peter;Bruce, Andrew;Gedeck, Peter)
      P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model. P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.

#### Can You Outsmart an Economist?: 100+ Puzzles to Train Your Brain (Landsburg, Steven E.)
      As a general rule, firms welcome monopoly power even when they’re not part of the monopoly. If anyone’s prices rise, then everyone’s prices can rise.

      moral—a moral we seem to keep coming back to: sometimes the obvious is the enemy of the true.

      The price system does the best possible job of producing any given quantity of wheat (or anything else) at the lowest possible cost. No czar, no planning board, and no other mechanism can do better.

      The chief merit of the price system is that it makes effective use of information that is not available to any single decision maker. When the price system is overridden, information is discarded. When information is discarded, resources are misallocated. When resources are misallocated, prosperity suffers. If you’re trying to make people prosperous, relying on prices is your best strategy.

#### UFOs (Kean, Leslie)
      By comparing nuclear tests to some 150 visual/radar UFO cases collected since 1947, we note that the curves are practically superimposed in time and that they coincide, with not more than a few months appearing between the number of explosions and one of the UFO appearances. This similarity in the two curves would suggest that the proven presence of UFOs is related to the nuclear strategic activity in the world. I base my hypothesis on my studies of official documents, the places and zones of UFO sightings, and remarks made by highly placed civilian and military persons involved in secret programs. There have been numerous instances of UFOs flying over or near strategic air command and other military bases in the United States, especially as documented during the 1960s.

      After my many years studying the most important unexplained cases, I think we have reached a certain level of knowledge about UFOs. They seem to be artificial and controlled objects whose physical characteristics

      I do know one thing, without a doubt: These objects were under intelligent control.

      Personally, according to my best judgment, I am in agreement with the findings of the French COMETA Report: There is a high probability UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin.

      Four images from Brazil, known as the Trindade photographs, are among the best, most valuable photos ever taken. The Brazilian government

      The events of that night were really amazing, and some of our simple questions have simple answers: Did the pilots see the phenomena? Yes. Did the radars spot them? Yes. Did Ozires and other military pilots see them? Yes. Did pilots in commercial aircraft see them? Yes. Do the times of the sightings correlate? Yes. Do the trajectories of the objects correlate? Yes; all of this was technically analyzed. So, did it happen? Yes, it did happen.

      Dr. Richard C. Henry, a prominent professor of astrophysics at Johns Hopkins University, was then deputy director of NASA’s Astrophysics Division and involved in the decision-making process. In a 1988 published essay, Henry takes issue with Frosch’s claim of “an absence of tangible or physical evidence.” He says there was an abundance of relevant evidence at the time, a situation that he, as head of the Astrophysics Division, was certainly aware of.

      Yet, the reality is that UFOs are not matters of belief, but facts. Many thousands of reports worldwide describe unexplained objects in the sky. Most consist only of eyewitness testimony, which might be disregarded as unreliable—and some undoubtedly actually are—but the fact that many UFO reports come from “expert witnesses” like commercial and air force pilots, air traffic controllers, cosmonauts, and scientists should give one pause. However, some UFO reports are also corroborated by physical evidence, including scientifically analyzed photo and video images, physical ground traces affecting plants and soil, effects on aircraft, and anomalous radar tracks. In modern society, physical evidence is normally considered definitive evidence of reality, objective evidence for something that has a cause in the physical world. By this criterion, then, at least some UFOs are clearly real. The question that makes them a problem is: Could they be extraterrestrial?

      One oft-told tale about Kissinger … involved a report that Winston Lord had worked on for days. After giving it to Kissinger, he got it back with the notation, “Is this the best you can do?” Lord rewrote and polished and finally resubmitted it; back it came with the same curt question. After redrafting it one more time—and once again getting the same question from Kissinger—Lord snapped, “Damn it, yes, it’s the best I can do.” To which Kissinger replied: “Fine, then I guess I’ll read it this time.”

#### Complexity (Mitchell, Melanie)
      Entropy is a measure of the energy that cannot be converted into additional work. The term “entropy” comes from another Greek word—“trope”—meaning “turning into” or “transformation.”

      Turing’s proof of the uncomputability of the Halting problem, sketched above, uses precisely the same core idea as Gödel’s incompleteness proof. Gödel figured out a way to encode mathematical statements so that they could talk about themselves. Turing figured out a way to encode mathematical statements as Turing machines and thus run on one another.

      Evolution is a gradual process, occurring via natural selection on very small random variations in individuals. Variation of this sort is highly abundant in populations and is not biased in any direction (e.g., it does not intrinsically lead to “improvement,” as believed by Lamarck). The source of individual variation is random genetic mutations and recombinations. Macroscale phenomena, such as the origin of new species, can be explained by the microscopic process of gene variation and natural selection.

      Furthermore, Gould and his colleagues attacked the third pillar of the Synthesis by proposing that some of the large-scale phenomena of evolution cannot be explained

      “The [IAS] School of Mathematics has a permanent establishment which is divided into three groups, one consisting of pure mathematics, one consisting of theoretical physicists, and one consisting of Professor von Neumann.”

      Wolfram’s proposed principle consists of four parts: The proper way to think about processes in nature is that they are computing. Since even very simple rules (or “programs”) such as Rule 110 can support universal computation, the ability to support universal computation is very common in nature. Universal computation is an upper limit on the complexity of computations in nature. That is, no natural system or process can produce behavior that is “noncomputable.” The computations done by different processes in nature are almost always equivalent in sophistication.

      when a social norm collides with a market norm, the social norm goes away for a long time. In other words, social relationships are not easy to reestablish. Once the bloom is off the rose—once a social norm is trumped by a market norm—it will rarely return.

      Open-source software shows the potential of social norms. In the case of Linux and other collaborative projects, you can post a problem about a bug on one of the bulletin boards and see how fast someone, or often many people, will react to your request and fix the software—using their own leisure time. Could you pay for this level of service? Most likely. But if you had to hire people of the same caliber they would cost you an arm and a leg. Rather, people in these communities are happy to give their time to society at large (for which they get the same social benefits we all get from helping a friend paint a room).

      We have an irrational compulsion to keep doors open. It's just the way we're wired.

      If this were not enough, some of the objects were found to be emitting radio waves, in one case at the 8 hertz (Hz), 14 megahertz (MHz), and 19 gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. All natural, terrestrial objects emit electromagnetic radiation—ranging from long-frequency radio waves to short-frequency microwaves, depending on their temperature. However, in the case of the objects retrieved by Dr.

      To manage complex affairs properly, it is necessary to be cold enough in vision to separate the power hungry and self-serving pseudoadvocate of the status quo from the genuine conservative; and the self-deceptive, irresponsible rebel without a cause from the truly creative. And to manage this means to separate those factors within the confines of one’s own soul, as well as among other people.

Ruck says the “drug man.” Either way, it’s unlikely a Greek speaker of the first century AD would have heard the name Iesous and not thought of Ieso or Iaso, the Greek goddess of healing and the daughter of Asclepius, who was taught the art of drugs, incantations, and love potions by the centaur Chiron.4 It’s

#### Process and Reality (Gifford Lectures Delivered in the University of Edinburgh During the Session 1927-28) (Whitehead, Alfred North)
      Speculative Philosophy is the endeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be interpreted.

      Metaphysical categories are not dogmatic statements of the obvious; they are tentative formulations of the ultimate generalities.

      Then the one which is not, if it is to maintain itself, must have the being of not-being as the bond of not-being, just as being must have as a bond the not-being of not-being in order to perfect its own being; for the truest assertion of the being of being and of the not-being of not-being is when being partakes of the being of being, and not of the being of not- being—that is, the perfection of being; and when not-being does not partake of the not-being of not-being but of the being of not-being—that is the perfection of not-being.

      There is something ridiculous in the expression "master of himself;" for the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.

      And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as first principles, but only as hypotheses— that is to say, as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.

      Schizophrenics, like philosophers, have a problem with the sense of the self which ordinary individuals, involved with living, lack.

      So language is a hybrid. It evolved from music and in this part of its history represented the urge to communicate; and to the extent that it retains right-hemisphere empathic elements, it still does. Its foundations lie in the body and the world of experience. But referential language, with its huge vocabulary and sophisticated syntax, did not originate in a drive to communicate, and from this point of view, represents something of a hijack. It has done everything it can to repudiate both its bodily origins and its dependency on experience – to become a world unto itself.

      We cannot give them our understanding, only awaken their own, latent, understanding.

      ‘Philosophy begins and ends with wondering – profound wondering.’

      ‘thoughts are the shadows of our feelings—always darker, emptier, simpler’.

      Here is Schlegel again: ‘Where philosophy stops, poetry has to begin … Whatever can be done while poetry and philosophy are separated has been done and accomplished. So the time has come to unite the two.’

      Kant also, it may be noted, remained single, and died probably a virgin.

      Perhaps the single most important one is what Sass calls hyperconsciousness. Elements of the self and of experience which normally remain, and need to remain, intuitive, unconscious, become the objects of a detached, alienating attention; and levels of consciousness multiply, so that there is an awareness of one’s own awareness, and so on.

#### Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 12 (Jung, C. G.)
      The demand made by the imitatio Christi—that we should follow the ideal and seek to become like it—ought logically to have the result of developing and exalting the inner man. In actual fact, however, the ideal has been turned by superficial and formalistically-minded believers into an external object of worship, and it is precisely this veneration for the object that prevents it from reaching down into the depths of the psyche and giving the latter a wholeness in keeping with the ideal.

      We can easily translate these ideas into the concretism of Freudian theory: the temenos would then be the womb of the mother and the rite a regression to incest. But these are the neurotic misunderstandings of people who have remained partly infantile and who do not realize that such things have been practised since time immemorial by adults whose activities cannot possibly be explained as a mere regression to infantilism. Otherwise the highest and most important achievements of mankind would ultimately be nothing but the perverted wishes of children, and the word “childish” would have lost its raison d’être.

It was Bubbamu herself – grown astonishingly old – carrying as many frog-people as she could bear. ‘What a childish trick to play on myself’ she thought. ‘I must have travelled around the whole of time the other way, bringing the frog people with me.

      Imagery of this nature can be found throughout the world’s mystical traditions. In one of his sermons, the Christian mystic Meister Eckhart writes: I once had a dream. I dreamt that I, even though a man, was pregnant; pregnant and full with Nothingness, like a woman is with child. And that out of this Nothingness, God was born… The being and the nature of God are mine… What good is it to me for the Creator to give birth to his Son if I also do not give birth to him in my time and my culture?2

If you die of starvation, you will suffer all the starvation there has been or will be. If ten thousand people die with you, their participation in your lot will not make you be ten thousand times more hungry nor multiply the time of your agony ten thousand times. Do not let yourself be overcome by the horrible sum of human sufferings; such a sum does not exist. Neither poverty nor pain are cumulative.”

      Our destiny (in contrast to Swedenborg's hell and the hell of Tibetan mythology) is not frightful because it is unreal; it is frightful because it is irreversible and ironbound. Time is the substance of which I am made. Time is a river which sweeps me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger which mangles me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire which consumes me, but I am the fire. The world, unfortunately, is real; I, unfortunately, am Borges.

      This vertical dimension is what the early Nishida Kitarō called junsui keiken, pure experience. This is not the experience of something but rather experience before it divides into an experiencing subject and an experienced object. It is to “see” (beyond seer and seen) the formless form and to “hear” (beyond auditor and audited) the soundless sound.

      I reached the end of reason, reached the limit of words, reached the end of all human skill or ability. Ordinary mental processes, consciousness, and emotions all ceased to function. It was as though I was encased in a sheet of ice ten thousand feet thick or sitting inside a bottle of pure crystal. My breath itself seemed to hang suspended. Then, in the middle of the night, a wonderful thing happened. As the sound of a distant bell reached my ears, I suddenly broke through into great enlightenment. It was mind and body falling away; fallen away mind and body. . . . The great earth completely and utterly vanished. Not a particle remained. (HP, 25–26)

      Fat Charlie was thirsty and his head hurt and his mouth tasted evil and his eyes were too tight in his head and all his teeth twinged and his stomach burned and his back was aching in a way that started around his knees and went up to his forehead and his brains had been removed and replaced with cotton balls and needles and pins which was why it hurt to try and think, and his eyes were not just too tight in his head but they must have rolled out in the night and been reattached with roofing nails; and now he noticed that anything louder than the gentle Brownian motion of air molecules drifting softly past each other was above his pain threshold. Also, he wished he were dead.

      “The meaning of life is the hot blood of your prey on your tongue, the meat that rends beneath your teeth, the corpse of your enemy left in the sun for the carrion eaters to finish.

#### The Embodied Mind, revised edition (Varela, Francisco J.)
      Although it may seem as if there is a single, abiding self that functions as the controller of the mind, cognitive science indicates that what we call “the mind” is a collection of constantly changing, emergent processes that arise within a complex system comprising the brain, the rest of the body, and the physical and social environment, and in which we find no single, abiding, and controlling self.

      Survival means that the organism must preserve the integrity of its boundaries while having constant interchange with the environment.

      We hold with Merleau-Ponty that Western scientific culture requires that we see our bodies both as physical structures and as lived, experiential structures—in short, as both “outer” and “inner,” biological and phenomenological.

      This undercurrent of restlessness, grasping, anxiety, and unsatisfactoriness that pervades experience is called Dukkha, usually translated as suffering.

      The tension between the ongoing sense of self in ordinary experience and the failure to find that self in reflection is of central importance in Buddhism—the origin of human suffering is just this tendency to grasp onto and build a sense of self, an ego, where there is none.

#### The Gateless Gate: The Classic Book of Zen Koans (Yamada, Kōun)
      For unenlightened people, every koan is a barrier. For the enlightened person, however, there is no gate, no barrier at all. This is because the essential world is totally void. We cannot see anything there. There is neither gate nor barrier, and so-called enlightened people are those who have realized this fact.

      Mu has no meaning whatsoever. If you want to solve the problem of Mu, you must become one with it! You must forget yourself in working on it. Your consciousness must be completely absorbed in your practice of Mu.

      Mumon says, “It will be just as if you had snatched the great sword of General Kan: If you meet a Buddha, you will kill him. If you meet a patriarch, you will kill him. Though you may stand on the brink of life and death, you will enjoy the great freedom. In the six realms and the four modes of birth, you will live in the samadhi of innocent play.”

      There is an ancient Zen text called Believing in Mind (Shinjin-Mei), in which the line appears: “One is everything. Everything is one.”

      “Form is nothing but emptiness; emptiness is nothing but form.”

      What is a fact in Zen? It is the manifestation of essential nature by an action such as standing up, sitting down, eating, drinking, crying, or laughing. In the case of Jōshū’s Mu, Mu is the fact. In the case of Gutei’s finger, raising a finger is the fact. In this case, the fact is some action of the man in the tree.

#### Alice in Wonderland Collection – All Four Books: Alice in Wonderland, Alice Through the Looking Glass, Hunting of the Snark and Alice Underground (Illustrated) (Carroll, Lewis)
      She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),

      'In that direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives a Hatter: and in that direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.' 'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked. 'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.' 'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice. 'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'

      "Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise."'

      'Beware the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!'

      "The time has come," the Walrus said, "To talk of many things: Of shoes—and ships—and sealing-wax— Of cabbages—and kings— And why the sea is boiling hot— And whether pigs have wings."

      'Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall: Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the King's horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.'

      'Or else it doesn't, you know. The name of the song is called "Haddocks' Eyes."' 'Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?' Alice said, trying to feel interested. 'No, you don't understand,' the Knight said, looking a little vexed. 'That's what the name is called. The name really is "The Aged Man."' 'Then I ought to have said "That's what the song is called"?' Alice corrected herself. 'No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing! The song is called "Ways and Means": but that's only what it's called, you know!' 'Well, what IS the song, then?' said Alice, who was by this time completely bewildered. 'I was coming to that,' the Knight said. 'The song really is "A-Sitting on a Gate": and the tune's my own invention.'

#### Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering (Glass, Robert L.)
      The software industry is in the same state of affairs that the pharmaceutical industry was in during the late nineteenth century. Sometimes it seems that we have more snake-oil salespeople and doomsayers than sensible folks practicing and preaching in our midst.

      The two causes of runaways that stand head and shoulders above all others are poor (usually optimistic) estimation and unstable requirements.

      What constituted an error of omitted logic? Such things as the failure to reset a data item to its original value after it had been used but was needed again and conditional statements with one or more conditions left out—the kinds of things that resulted from coders and designers not thinking sufficiently deeply about the problem they were addressing.

      Old hardware becomes obsolete; old software goes into production every night.

      Quality is an elusive term. And it is especially elusive in the software field. The elusiveness of the term is the primary focus of that wonderful book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (Pirsig 1974). The main character of the book, an academic looking into the real meaning of the word, went mad seeking a workable definition!

      The computer science field, which is stuck teaching writing programs before reading them, knowing that is wrong but doesn’t seem to know how to fix it.

      There are sure a lot of people in the software world who would like to believe that one size fits all. Those selling methodologies. Those defining process approaches. Those pushing tools and techniques. Those hoping to build component-based software. Those setting standards. Those doing research toward the next software engineering holy grail. Those academics who put the prefix meta- in front of whatever they’re working on. All of them are seeking that “universal software elixir.” Many of them even believe they have found it. All too many of them want to sell it to you!

      Reality is the murder of a beautiful theory by a gang of ugly facts.

#### Fight Club: A Novel (Palahniuk, Chuck)
      The three ways to make napalm: One, you can mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate. Two, you can mix equal parts of gasoline and diet cola. Three, you can dissolve crumbled cat litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.

      Sometimes, Tyler speaks for me.

      Marla’s heart looked the way my face was. The crap and the trash of the world. Post-consumer human butt wipe that no one would ever go to the trouble to recycle.

      "The liberator who destroys my property,” Tyler said, "is fighting to save my spirit. The teacher who clears all possessions from my path will set me free.”

      Arson meets on Monday. Assault on Tuesday. Mischief meets on Wednesday. And Misinformation meets on Thursday. Organized Chaos. The Bureaucracy of Anarchy. You figure it out. Support groups. Sort

      "Drunk Drivers Against Mothers.” "Recycle All the Animals.”

      "I Drive Better When I’m Drunk.”

      "You had a near-life experience,” the mechanic says.

      Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don’t really need.

      You didn’t say anything. Get out of here, and do your little life, but remember I’m watching you, Raymond Hessel, and I’d rather kill you than see you working a shit job for just enough money to buy cheese and watch television.

      Set your watch ahead an hour. If you can wake up in a different place. If you can wake up in a different time. Why can’t you wake up as a different person?

      "Every time you fall asleep,” Tyler says, "I run off and do something wild, something crazy, something completely out of my mind.”

      THAT OLD SAYING, about how you always kill the thing you love, well, it works both ways. And it does work both ways.

      How everything you ever love will reject you or die. Everything you ever create will be thrown away. Everything you’re proud of will end up as trash. I am Ozymandias, king of kings.

#### Systems Performance (Gregg, Brendan)
      Casual benchmarking: you benchmark A, but actually measure B, and conclude you’ve measured C.

      6I could repurpose a famous saying: A man with one tracer knows what events happened; a man with two tracers knows that one of them is broken, and searches lkml hoping for a patch.

#### There Is No Antimemetics Division (qntm)
      Asynchronous research — whereby the research topic is forgotten entirely between iterations, and rediscovered over and over — is a perfectly standard practice in the Antimemetics Division,

      "SCP-3125 is a five-dimensional anomalous metastasized mass of bad memes and bad antimemes and everything in between, seeping through to our physical reality. It isn't coherent and it isn't intelligent. It can't communicate. This is an auditory hallucination."

      "When I first joined the Foundation, I asked my mentor, who retired many years ago, 'What's the biggest anomaly we've ever contained?' That he was cleared for, I meant, of course. And he told me about a very old rumor he once heard, back in his earliest days, when he was just starting out. The rumor was that Abrahamic religions had not always been monotheistic. Originally, there were three capital-G Gods. And sometime in the past hundred and fifty years, the Foundation had killed two of them.

#### TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series) (R., Fall Kevin)
      With best-effort delivery, the network does not expend much effort to ensure that data is delivered without errors or gaps.

      With layering, each layer is responsible for a different facet of the communications.

      There are three types of IP addresses, and the type affects how forwarding is performed: unicast (destined for a single host), broadcast (destined for all hosts on a given network), and multicast (destined for a set of hosts that belong to a multicast group).

      The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an adjunct to IP, and we label it as a layer 3.5 protocol.

      This notion is the basis for the so-called Metcalfe’s Law, which states roughly that the value of a computer network is proportional to the square of the number of connected endpoints (e.g., users or devices).

#### Notes from the Underground (Fyodor Dostoevsky)
      but in despair there are the most intense enjoyments, especially when one is very acutely conscious of the hopelessness of one’s position.

      Oh, if I had done nothing simply from laziness! Heavens, how I should have respected myself, then. I should have respected myself because I should at least have been capable of being lazy;

      corporal punishment is better than nothing.

      It somehow happened quite suddenly that I alternated between despising them and thinking them superior to myself. A cultivated and decent man cannot be vain without setting a fearfully high standard for himself, and without despising and almost hating himself at certain moments.

      Every decent man of our age must be a coward and a slave. That is his normal condition. Of that I am firmly

      Sometimes I was positively choked with resentment.
