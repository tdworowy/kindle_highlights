#### How Not to Be Wrong (Ellenberg, Jordan)
      Mathematics is the study of things that come out a certain way because there is no other way they could possibly be. Now let’s be fair: not everything in mathematics can be

      Math is like an atomic-powered prosthesis that you attach to your common sense, vastly multiplying its reach and strength.

      repeating decimal 0.99999… … equal to 1? I have seen people come nearly to blows over this question.* It’s hotly disputed on websites ranging from World of Warcraft fan pages to Ayn Rand forums.

      An important rule of mathematical hygiene: when you’re field-testing a mathematical method, try computing the same thing several different ways. If you get several different answers, something’s wrong with your method. For example: the 2004 bombings at the Atocha train

      Don’t talk about percentages of numbers when the numbers might be negative.

      What Sherlock Holmes should have said was: “It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth, unless the truth is a hypothesis it didn’t occur to you to consider.”

      A reasonable person believes, in short, that each of his beliefs is true and that some of them are false.”

      Believe whatever you believe by day; but at night, argue against the propositions you hold most dear. Don’t cheat! To the greatest extent possible you have to think as though you believe what you don’t believe. And if you can’t talk yourself out of your existing beliefs, you’ll know a lot more about why you believe what you believe. You’ll have come a little closer to a proof.

      Every time you observe that more of a good thing is not always better; or you remember that improbable things happen a lot, given enough chances, and resist the lure of the Baltimore stockbroker; or you make a decision based not just on the most likely future, but on the cloud of all possible futures, with attention to which ones are likely and which ones are not; or you let go of the idea that the beliefs of groups should be subject to the same rules as beliefs of individuals; or, simply, you find that cognitive sweet spot where you can let your intuition run wild on the network of tracks formal reasoning makes for it; without writing down an equation or drawing a graph, you are doing mathematics, the extension of common sense by other means. When are you going to use it? You’ve been using mathematics since you were born and you’ll probably never stop. Use it well.
