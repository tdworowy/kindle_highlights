#### Hoaxed: Everything They Told You is a Lie (Cernovich, Mike)
      "To get more out of life, you must get more out of yourself. You must take personal responsibility for your thoughts and emotions. You must stop blaming the system. Your days of looking outside of yourself for answers are gone."

      But as a viewer and listener, be cautious. Most audio is clipped for a reason, and that's because there is other context that would explain it.

      Walter Duranty of The New York Times won a Pulitizer Prize for his reporting on Stalin. According to Duranty, no one in the Ukraine or Soviet Union were starving. Reports about famines were fake news.

      To understand the media requires you to set aside logic and reasoning. Embrace the double standard.

      You'll have some stories for life that you can never tell, and besides, no one would believe those stories.

      Most people go into politics because they couldn't make it in business, cut it as a real writer, or invent anything in tech. Why do you think tech journalists are nasty? When you have an IQ of 115, the Dunning–Kruger effect kicks in. You're smart enough to think you understand a company like Uber, but you'd never have had the vision, aggression, or focus to start such a company.

      libertarians who hate Neo-Cons, who hate Paleo-Cons, who hate Anarcho-Capitalists, who hate Hotep, you know, who hate the alt-light, [who] hate the alt-right, [who] hate the new right. There’s-, there’s a whole cornucopia of people out here. The

      And so, the problem is if the media is hypocritical, the response is not to respond to hypocrisy with more hypocrisy.

      And so, this idea of fake news is sort of a misnomer. Because fake news creates real opinions, which creates real actions.

      But they're able to change the rights of people based on the identities that they ascribe to them.

      have an infinite faith in the power of free people to make the correct policy decisions if they're given the facts.

      That's probably the greatest problem in our society: People don't-, people don't really want to see and know what's true. They don't. They want to live in a fantasy world.

      Infowars’ greatest accomplish is simply pointing out that there is a worldwide corporate government being set up that is tax exempt and has diplomatic immunity.

      Okay, let's talk about the left-wing bias in the mainstream media — because I am a liberal. I'm a registered Democrat. I have always been my entire adult life. And it wasn't until I became the subject of a smear campaign that I started to see through the liberal bias of the mainstream media. And now I see it everywhere. Everywhere! I mean, it's not just the news. It's the TV shows you watch and it's commercials and it's everywhere. It's the music videos that are being put out...it's the VMA Awards...it's everywhere. It's not just news television shows.

      free.” They say “unregulated” when they mean “free.” And it very much went against the wisdom of the time to say that a centrally planned economy cannot possibly work. It doesn't matter the intentions. It doesn't matter the virtues. It doesn't matter the processes or procedures that go in place. You simply can't make it work.

      They keep losing the argument — ideologically, empirically, factually. They keep losing the argument, but they won't let go of the ideology. And so they have no choice but to escalate.

      And it's-, of course! To expect non-hypocrisy from most people in the intellectual realm is a fantasy. In my particular-, I can’t prove this, but I think there's strong reasonable arguments behind it: Language, philosophy, ethics, universality was invented by and for hypocrisy. Because if I can create a moral rule that says, “Don't use violence,” and then except myself from that moral rule, I have disarmed you, and I'm now elevated and powerful. If I go into a boxing ring, and I've convinced the guy verbally to not fight back very hard — or not fight back at all — but, look at that!: World Champion.

      Hypocrisy is why universals and ethics are invented, and the fact that the left uses it merely confirms that thesis.

      So, people don't listen to reason and evidence. The question is, then: “How do they change their minds?” And the sad truth is that they change their minds based on how certain you are. They can't judge your ideas. They can only judge how you judge your ideas. And if you are all-in, and you are certain, and you are

      The studies are very clear: It doesn't doesn't change people's minds at all. In fact, when somebody has a fixed belief, and you give them opposing reason and evidence as factual, it hardens their belief. It reinforces their error. You're actually making your enemy stronger by bringing reason and evidence to a sophistry fight.

      “I'm not going to let giant political decisions, involving billions or trillions of dollars and essential human freedoms, to be driven by pianos and sad eyes,”

      Piano is not an argument. People being sad is not an argument.

      There is no long-term future for fiat currency. There never has been, in the entire history of the world. All fiat currencies fail. The longest it's ever lasted is the British pound sterling — about 400 years. But it's lost ninety-eight percent of its value over that time. There is no long-term future for fiat currencies. And the future is in whatever can't be manufactured

      By God, I hope the future of news are facts. I hope that the future of news is illumination.

      This is what Gaddafi said very clearly: “You take me down — I am the barrier between Africa and Europe — you take me down, and you will have floods of migrants.”

      don't blame the migrants. It is a perfectly rational resource acquisition strategy to spend a couple of thousand bucks or a couple of hundred bucks, or however much it costs, for various people to get in.

      And there was this massive panic. And DDT was banned around the world. Now some very credible scholarship has been poured into this to try and figure out what has been the fallout of this ban. And some fairly conservative estimates put the death count that resulted from the increases in malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases that came out of this DDT ban — because if you didn't have the DDT, you got a whole lot more mosquitoes — at about 60 million people. About 60 million people have died as a result of this DDT hysteria.

      I mean, it's a moving target. Doesn't matter. They just hate the free market. Because they can't compete in the free market. Because their sophists. And they're manipulators. And the one thing that is very true, in my experience, of people on the left: Nothing spells, “rational pragmatism,” like working with your hands once in your goddamn life. Work with your hands. Do you know how dangerous it has been? People don't grow their own food anymore. Try having a tantrum because your watermelon didn't grow. Try screaming at your tomato plants. “More tomatoes! I need them!” But, you can scream at the government. You can scream at guilty people and they'll give you resources so you'll shut up and go away. Try screaming at a cow — she'll just shit on your hand rather than give you milk.

      been so relentlessly just proven wrong time and again, they have to reject reality. But they don't want to reject the consequences of rejecting reality. Which is: They should shut the hell up about truth and virtue and goodness and rightness, and they should stop complaining about other people who have different moral perspectives from theirs, because they don't even really believe those people exist. So why would you bother? I don't spend a lot of time lecturing puppets because puppets don't exist as conscious entities.

      You participate in the technological society and you, by participating in it, you indicate your assent to the ontological presuppositions and the epistemological presuppositions upon which it's based. And you might say, “Well, no I don't.” And I would say, “Well, who cares what you say?” I'm going to watch how you act as a better indicator of your fundamental truth, and there's no reason to assume whatsoever that what you say and what you do are in alignment, like, they might be, but often with people they’re not in alignment at all.

      “But, no, I really have a tremendous amount of hatred and I'm going to take it out on anyone who's foreign.” Now, that's sort of typical of that-, of the Nazi-type ultranationalists. And then, on the left, it's like, “Well, I like the poor and the oppressed and I stand for them.” It's like, “Well, no, you're just resentful and jealous and-, and you don't believe that hard work matters, because you don't work hard and you don't plan to, and so, you can place a mask of virtue over your miserable, destructive resentment and then you can tolerate looking at yourself in the mirror.” And so, I mean, this is why I'm no fan of ideologies, generally speaking, because they have exactly that property.

      when you act out a falsehood, then something terrible happens. That's the definition of a falsehood, fundamentally.

      Now, so, imagine that your belief systems are essentially maps of the world, so, they're maps that you use to orient yourself with, because we move from point to point, right? We're active creatures and then those maps are very complexly structured — they're sort of hierarchically structured. And so, for example, you have some assumptions that are predicates of more of your actions than others.

      And so, the prestige is related to the power of the-, of the institution to change perception and behavior. Well, so it's-, it's-, it's the brand, so you could say the brand is the marker of that prestige that’s being stored up across time. Yeah.

      Like, you know, I can put up a YouTube video that I make in a day, and it'll have fifteen thousand views in a week. I can't do that with a book. That would take me three years and probably it wouldn’t happen. I probably wouldn't sell fifteen thousand copies. So, it's a whole new thing and it's-, God only knows how powerful it is. You know, we have no idea. It’s a Gutenberg Revolution for the spoken word.

      Nietzsche thought, well, human beings would have to become supermen, in some sense, in order to overcome the death of God. To bear it. And that they could do that, in some sense, by voluntarily recreating themselves.

      It's completely unlikely, but these old ideas, man, they're-, they're eternal. That's what they are. And you become dissociated from them at your extreme peril, psychologically and socially. So...

      How could it be otherwise than that which you should aim for is the highest good that you could conceive of?

      And so, we can't lose that, because the alternative...like, you think, “Well, what's worse?” Is there anything worse than voluntarily accepting your own crucifixion, so to speak? Yeah! Running from it!

      But there's no pain-free way out. So, you’re either going to act nobly in the face of that and try to make things better, or you’re going to act in a cowardly, deceitful and resentful fashion, and make everything worse.

      You know, we think people have meaningless lives because they've abandoned God and they're nihilistic and, isn't that a catastrophe for them? It's like, yeah, it's a catastrophe. But it's not clear to me that it's more difficult than the alternative, which is to think, “Oh, you're actually responsible for your decisions, and they’re decisions between good and evil, and your decisions tilt the world towards Heaven or Hell in a very real way.” Directly, it's on you. It's like, who wants to believe that? That's meaning. That's meaning. You want meaning? That's meaning. It's like, no, man! I’ll take the nihilism. And the despair. It’s easier.

      totalitarian states would not have been possible without the moral corruption of the individuals within that society.

      let's say, then your suffering is just fine, because you haven't learned your lesson yet.

      even though I'm a libertarian — which is not really right-wing, because I don't care who marries who, and I don't have a right-wing orthodoxy, I'm more of a Libertarian

      “If you're wrong on the facts, hit the other side in an ad hominem sort of a way to deconstruct the opposing side to the jury. If you disfigure and get the jury to hate that person — even if they're right — the jury will side with you.” So

      Learn how to be resilient. Learn how to fight back. And remember what your grandmother told you: What other people think of you is none of your business.

      fascism is that you have to distort the truth, right? If you read Joe Goebbels’-, Joseph Goebbels' biography: The bigger the lie, the more impact and the more believable it will be. And so, that's coming from the left. Now, the left will be super mad at me for saying that. But that's actually the truth.

      And if we don't reset the country and reset the social contract, we run the risk of — and, again, am I talking about a revolution — but we run the risk of turning the country into something different than what it was that we grew up in. I grew up in the opportunistic-, I grew up in the aspirational working class. The working class today is desperate. And so, the reason I'm doing it is I want to really help that, because the country's been so good to me.

      for people that are watching this documentary. Nobody is the way they are actually portrayed in the media. Everybody is very, very different.

      know, Steve Jobs — took a Glock and capped the iPod. “Why'd ya kill the iPod, Steve?” “Well, someone was going to kill it — it might as well have been me.”

      People forget today — I'll make this statement, because I was there. People forget today how disorganized and how entrepreneurially lunatic-oriented we were inside that campaign. And so, it just wasn't that kind of campaign.
