#### A Short History of Modern Philosophy (Routledge Classics) (Scruton, Roger)
      Philosophy seems to occupy some intermediate place between science and literature

      By ‘God’ I mean an entity than which no greater can be thought. Suppose that God, so defined, does not exist; I can nevertheless think that he exists. But an entity is greater if it does exist than if it does not. Hence it is possible to think of something greater than God—namely an entity which is not only greater than any that can be thought, but which also exists. But this is contrary to the definition.
