#### Enterprise Continuous Testing: Transforming Testing for Agile and DevOps (Platz, Wolfgang)
      Design tests that cover your risks as efficiently as possible Automate tests rapidly, with minimal maintenance See the risk impact of your test failures Identify critical “blind spots” that are not yet tested Prepare your automation for constant, consistent execution within CI Balance test automation with creative exploration

      With risk coverage, the focus shifts from the number of requirements tested to the risk weight of the requirements tested. You can usually achieve much higher risk coverage by testing 10 critical requirements than you can by testing 100 more trivial ones.

      Simplify automation across the technology stack End the test maintenance nightmare Shift to API testing whenever feasible

      Choose the right tool(s) for your needs

      Test automation is perfect for repeatedly checking whether incremental application changes break your existing functionality. However, test automation falls short for determining if new functionality truly meets expectations. Does it address the business needs behind the user story? Does it do so in a way that’s easy to use, resource-efficient, reliable, and consistent with the rest of your application?
