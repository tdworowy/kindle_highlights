#### The Kyoto School (Carter, Robert E.)
      He simplified his approach when he wrote that the Western cultures are cultures of being, while Eastern cultures are cultures of nothingness

      “To experience means to know facts just as they are, to know in accordance with facts by completely relinquishing one's own fabrications. What we usually refer to as experience is adulterated with some sort of thought, so by pure I am referring to the state of experience just as it is without the least addition of deliberative discrimination

      Greek logos, like the Japanese morotomo, is “to gather,” or to be together with someone or something, as with a friend.

      “I think that we can distinguish the West to have considered being as the ground of reality, the East to have taken nothingness as its ground.

      Nothingness is that undivided something out of which God arises.

      “to exist while being absolutely nothing is the ultimate self-contradiction.”

      “In mediating the absolute through metanoetic confession of its own finitude and powerlessness, the relative ethical subject cooperates to make manifest the absolute nothingness of religion. Religion mediates itself to ethics through metanoesis in order to actualize an absolute mediation of the absolute-qua-relative. Metanoesis is both the gate through which ethics passes over into religion and the axis around which religion converts to ethics.”

      Nishitani which describes this kind of existential despair: “My life as a young man can be described in a single phrase: it was a period absolutely without hope…. My life at the time lay entirely in the grips of nihility and despair…. My decision, then, to study philosophy was in fact—melodramatic as it might sound—a matter of life and death.”

      “What I am talking about is the point at which the nihility that lies hidden as a reality at the ground of the self and all things makes itself present as a reality to the self in such a way that self-existence, together with the being of all things, turns into a single doubt.”
