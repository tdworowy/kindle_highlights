#### Confession: Our Hidden Alien Encounters Revealed (Hastings, Robert)
      Jacobs’ books, The Threat: Revealing the Secret Alien Agenda and Walking Among Us: The Alien Plan to Control Humanity summarize his studies on this subject.

      How could a piece of iron having non-terrestrial characteristics find its way inside the human body?

      If this were not enough, some of the objects were found to be emitting radio waves, in one case at the 8 hertz (Hz), 14 megahertz (MHz), and 19 gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. All natural, terrestrial objects emit electromagnetic radiation—ranging from long-frequency radio waves to short-frequency microwaves, depending on their temperature. However, in the case of the objects retrieved by Dr.

      Leir, the emissions ceased within 60–90 days of their removal from the patient, suggesting that their existence was somehow related to, and perhaps dependent on, their being inside the human

      While analyzing the composition of the apparently artificial object via Inductively-Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry, Colbern found isotopic ratios in four elements—boron, magnesium, nickel, and copper—that aren’t found on Earth. Whomever created it had to

      have used one or more extraterrestrial sources for those elements in its manufacture. Also detected were trace elements such as iridium, gallium, and germanium, which are rare on Earth but abundant in iron-nickel meteorites.

      Furthermore, using a scanning electron microscope, Colbern found what appeared to be nano-scale, artificial structures, termed “carbon nanotubes”, suggestive of electrical current-carrying pathways. (A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter.) One independent source says,

      Other horn-shaped, nano-scale structures present in the sample, Colbern speculated, might be antennae. Radio waves—in the 1.2 GHz, 110 and 17 MHz, and 8 Hz bands

      A second memo, dated August 23, 1950, and titled, “Summary of Aerial Phenomena in New Mexico”, cited “approximately 150 observations” of “flying discs” and maneuvering “green fireballs” near the Los Alamos and Sandia atomic laboratories since 1948.

      Faulkner exploded in rage, got right up in my face, and snarled, “Yes, Robert, we knew about UFOs at SAFOI and if the public knew what we knew there would be panic! You and I are never going to talk about this again!”

      UFOs and Nukes. This book, containing the testimony of over 160 former and present military eyewitnesses, mine included, presents conclusive proof in any court of law which might try it, that UFOs, unidentified aerial craft, not of this Earth, are and have been meddling overtly with United States and European nuclear stockpiles and weaponry literally from the birth of the atomic age, in the deserts of New Mexico in 1947, to the present moment.
