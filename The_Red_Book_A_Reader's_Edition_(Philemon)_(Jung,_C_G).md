#### The Red Book: A Reader's Edition (Philemon) (Jung, C. G.)
      “Our age is seeking a new spring of life. I found one and drank of it and the water tasted good.”

      “To understand a thing is a bridge and possibility of returning to the path. But to explain a matter is arbitrary and sometimes even murder. Have you counted the murderers among the scholars?”

      But the spirit of the depths stepped up to me and said: “What you speak is. The greatness is, the intoxication is, the undignified, sick, paltry dailiness is. It runs in all the streets, lives in all the houses, and rules the day of all humanity. Even the eternal stars are commonplace. It is the great mistress and the one essence of God. One laughs

      But the spirit of the depths said: “No one can or should halt sacrifice. Sacrifice is not destruction, sacrifice is the foundation stone of what is to come. Have you not had monasteries? Have not countless thousands gone into the desert? You should carry the monastery in yourself. The desert is within you. The desert calls you and draws you back, and if you were fettered to the world of this time with iron, the call of the desert would break all chains. Truly, I prepare you for solitude.”

      Therefore give people dignity and let each of them stand apart, so that each may find his own fellowship and love it.

      My friends, it is wise to nourish the soul, otherwise you will breed dragons and devils in your heart.44

      If your virtues hinder you from salvation, discard them, since they have become evil to you. The slave to virtue finds the way as little as the slave to vices.70

      To the extent that the Christianity of this time lacks madness, it lacks divine life. Take

      But this is the bitterest for mortal men: our Gods want to be overcome, since they require renewal. If men kill their princes, they do so because they cannot kill their Gods, and because they do not know that they should kill their Gods in themselves.

      So meaning is a moment and a transition from absurdity to absurdity, and absurdity only a moment and a transition from meaning to meaning.121

      After death on the cross Christ went into the underworld and became Hell.

      You wanted this war. That is good. If you had not, then the evil of this war would be small.229 But with your wanting you make the evil great. If you do not succeed in producing the greatest evil out of this war, you will never learn the violent deed and learn to overcome fighting what lies outside you.230 Therefore it is good if you want this greatest evil with your whole heart.

      Yes, it seems to you like enslavement. You are a slave of what you need in your soul. The most masculine man needs women, and he is consequently their slave. Become a woman yourself,28 and you will be saved from slavery to woman.

      He who comprehends the darkness in himself, to him the light is near.

      You locked Satan in the abyss for a millennium, and when the millennium had passed, you laughed at him, since he had become a children’s fairy tale.72 But if the dreadful great one raises his head, the world winces. The most extreme coldness draws near.

      Some have their reason in thinking, others in feeling. Both are servants of Logos, and in secret become worshipers of the serpent.

      Thus my God found salvation. He was saved precisely by what one would actually consider fatal, namely by declaring him a figment of the imagination

      One used to believe that one could murder a God. But the God was saved, he forged a new axe in the fire, and plunged again into the flood of light of the East to resume his ancient cycle.117 But we clever men crept around lamed and poisoned, and did not even know that we lacked something.

      Nature is playful and terrible. Some see the playful side and dally with it and let it sparkle. Others see the horror and cover their heads and are more dead than alive. The way does not lead between both, but embraces both. It is both cheerful play and cold horror.139 [Image 69]140 69/73 [Image 70] 70/73 [Image 71]141 71/73 [Image 72]. 72/73

      He who does not want evil will have no chance to save his soul from Hell.

      If only false teachers teach, the people will kill the false teachers, and will fall into the truth even on the way of their sins.

      Only he who knows the darkest error knows what light is.

      No one saves us from the evil of becoming, unless we choose to go through Hell.

      “My reaction is far from personal. I am utterly restless, quickly hurrying life. I am never contented, never unperturbed. I pull everything down and hastily rebuild. I am ambition, greed for fame, lust for action; I am the fizz of

      The experience of the God in this form was unexpected and unwanted. I wish I could say it was a deception and only too willingly would I disown this experience. But I cannot deny that it has seized me beyond all measure and steadily goes on working in me. So if it is a deception, then deception is my God. Moreover, the God is in the deception.

      The God appears to us in a certain state of the soul. Therefore we reach the God through the self.34 35 Not the self is God, although we reach the God through the self. The God is behind the self, above the self, the self itself, when he appears. But he appears as our sickness, from which we must heal ourselves.36We must heal ourselves from the God, since he is also our heaviest wound.

      I must free my self from the God,39 since the God I experienced is more than love; he is also hate, he is more than beauty, he is also the abomination, he is more than wisdom, he is also meaninglessness, he is more than power, he is also powerlessness, he is more than omnipresence, he is also my creature.

      “Everything that you request from the Sun God produces a deed from the devil. Everything that you create with the Sun God gives effective power to the devil.

      Christ overcame the world by burdening himself with its suffering. But Buddha overcame both the pleasure and suffering of the world by disposing of both.

      You must be in the middle of life, surrounded by death on all sides. Stretched out, like one crucified, you hang in him, the fearful, the overpowering.

      Only by living life can you free yourself from it.
