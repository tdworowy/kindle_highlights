#### Python for DevOps (Noah Gift, Kennedy Behrman, Alfredo Deza, and Grig Gheorghiu)
      Do one right thing, then another, until you find clarity. First, set up a build server, start testing your code, and automate manual tasks. Do something; it can be anything, but have a “bias for action.” Do that first thing right and make sure it is automated.

      Many abstract concepts in the software industry are hard to define precisely. Cloud Computing, Agile, and Big Data are good examples of topics that can have many definitions depending on whom you talk to.

      Your curiosity and a never-ending pursuit of knowledge will continue to make you, and the environments you work on, much better.

      Instead of a hierarchy based on complete nonsense, a better approach to building reliable systems is to build them piece by piece. In additional, when creating the platform, failure should be expected regularly. The only thing that will affect this truism is if a powerful person is involved in building the architecture. In that case, this truism will be exponentially increased.

      No matter how smart/powerful/charismatic/creative/rich a person is, if they are manually applying critical changes in a crisis to your software platform, you are already dead. You just don’t know it yet. The alternative to this monstrous existence is automation.

      The same concept can be applied to Python, the language. Fully accepting the strengths and weaknesses of the language allows a developer to utilize it fully. Python is not a high-performance language. Python is not a language optimized for writing servers like other languages are: Go, Java, C, C++, C#, or Erlang. Instead, Python is a language for applying high-level logic on top of high-performance code written in a high-performance language or platform. Python is widely popular because

      As the saying went, the internet circa 2004 was held together with duct tape and bubble gum.

      Have everyone on your team fill out anonymous index cards that have three positive things and three valuable feedback items for each member of your small group (must have negative and positive issues). Get into a room and have each person read the index cards from their teammates. (Yes, this does work and can be a life-changing experience for individuals in your team.)
