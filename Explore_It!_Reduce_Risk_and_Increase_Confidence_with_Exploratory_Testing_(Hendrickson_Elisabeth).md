#### Explore It!: Reduce Risk and Increase Confidence with Exploratory Testing (Hendrickson, Elisabeth)
      There is the philosophical question: How do we know what we know? There is the economic question: When will we know enough to move forward with confidence? There is the psychological question: How do we convince each other that one more change is needed, or is not needed?

      “It is so frustrating,” she sighed. “No matter how many tests we write, no matter how many cases we execute, we always find the most serious bugs when we go off the script.”

      Your exploration has answered all the open questions, and you know of no more unknowns.  You are not learning anything new. You have characterized the capabilities, limitations, and risks of the existing implementation. As a result, you feel like you are dealing with a known quantity with no more surprises to be uncovered, at least for now.  More information will not change anything. You could gather more information, but there is no point. Your stakeholders have explicitly told you they do not need or want more information from exploring, and you know that no one will act on any information you find, including you.  Other information has more value. Perhaps you could find more information in a given area, but there are other, more pressing questions to address in other areas or on other charters.

      This is the essence of testing: designing an experiment to gather empirical evidence to answer a question about a risk.
