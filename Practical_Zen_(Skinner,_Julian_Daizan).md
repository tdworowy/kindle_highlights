#### Practical Zen (Skinner, Julian Daizan)
      Rather than being a thing in a world of things, we are a process in a world of processes.

      Shallow breathing is therefore both a response to stress and a trigger for the body’s stress response – a self-perpetuating harmful circle.

      During his lifetime, Bankei encountered criticism and opposition. He says, ‘When I was young and first began to declare the Unborn dharma, people had trouble understanding it. They thought I was preaching heresy or they took me for a Christian. They were afraid of me. No one would come near.’3

      perspectives of the same thing. I like the saying, ‘The opposite to a conventional truth is a lie, but the opposite to a profound truth is another profound truth.’

      koan is something that from the outside has no solution, but from the inside is no problem.

      Imagery of this nature can be found throughout the world’s mystical traditions. In one of his sermons, the Christian mystic Meister Eckhart writes: I once had a dream. I dreamt that I, even though a man, was pregnant; pregnant and full with Nothingness, like a woman is with child. And that out of this Nothingness, God was born… The being and the nature of God are mine… What good is it to me for the Creator to give birth to his Son if I also do not give birth to him in my time and my culture?2

      A man needs to draw this energy down and store it in the space below the navel, in the kikai tanden. If he maintains this for months and years without distraction, one morning, the elixir furnace will turn over and everywhere, within and without, will become one great circulating elixir. He will realise that he himself is older than heaven and earth, deathless as space. This is true alchemy.

      The famous Zen text, the Mumonkan (The Gateless Gate), says: ‘All the illusory ideas and delusive thoughts accumulated up to the present will be exterminated, and when the time comes, internal and external will be spontaneously united. You will know this, but for yourself only, like a dumb man who has a dream.’

      There are six great methods within the practice of counting the breath: counting, following, stopping, observing, returning to the source, and purification.

      Naikan (literally, ‘inner contemplation’). Hakuin’s preferred term for the practices are detailed in Yasenkana.
