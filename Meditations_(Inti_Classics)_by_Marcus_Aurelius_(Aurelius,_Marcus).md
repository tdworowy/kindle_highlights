#### Meditations (Inti Classics): by Marcus Aurelius (Aurelius, Marcus)
      Begin the morning by saying to thyself, I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil. But I who have seen the nature of the good that it is beautiful, and of the bad that it is ugly, and the nature of him who does wrong, that it is akin to me, not only of the same blood or seed, but that it participates in the same intelligence and the same portion of the divinity, I can neither be injured by any of them, for no one can fix on me what is ugly, nor can I be angry with my kinsman, nor hate him, For we are made for co-operation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth. To act against one another then is contrary to nature; and it is acting against one another to be vexed and to turn away.

      Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor the tranquility which others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept erect by others.

      The universe is transformation: life is opinion.

      not that this is a misfortune, but that to bear it nobly is good fortune.

      guardian and guide, a portion of himself. And this is every man's understanding and reason.

      and to how many ill-minded folks thou hast shown a kind disposition.  Why do unskilled and ignorant souls disturb him who has skill and knowledge? What soul then has skill and knowledge? That which knows beginning and end, and knows

      the reason which pervades all substance and through all time by fixed periods (revolutions) administers the universe.

      If a thing is difficult to be accomplished by thyself, do not think that it is impossible for man: but if anything is possible for man and conformable to his nature, think that this can be attained by thyself too.

      It is in our power to have no opinion about a thing, and not to be disturbed in our soul; for things themselves have no natural power to form our judgements.

      Where any work can be done conformably to the reason which is common to gods and men, there we have nothing to fear: for where we are able to get profit by means of the activity which is successful and proceeds according to our constitution, there no harm is to be suspected.

      In every pain let this thought be present, that there is no dishonour in it, nor does it make the governing intelligence worse, for it does not damage the intelligence either so far as the intelligence is rational or so far as it is social. Indeed in the case of most pains let this remark of Epicurus aid thee, that pain is neither intolerable nor everlasting, if thou bearest in mind that it has its limits, and if thou addest nothing to it in imagination: and remember this too, that we do not perceive that many things which are disagreeable to us are the same as pain, such as excessive drowsiness, and the being scorched by heat, and the having no appetite. When then thou art discontented about any of these things, say to thyself, that thou art yielding to pain.

      It is thy duty to order thy life well in every single act; and if every act does its duty, as far as is possible, be content;

      Receive wealth or prosperity without arrogance; and be ready to let it go.

      If any man has done wrong, the harm is his own. But perhaps he has not done wrong.

      No longer talk at all about the kind of man that a good man ought to be, but be such.

      Eighth, consider how much more pain is brought on us by the anger and vexation caused by such acts than by the acts themselves, at which we are angry and vexed.
