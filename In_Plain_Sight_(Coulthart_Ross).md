#### In Plain Sight (Coulthart, Ross)
      the most highly classified subject in the United States government, rating higher even than the H-bomb. Flying Saucers exist. Their modus operandi is unknown, but a concentrated effort is being made by a small group headed by Dr Vannevar Bush. The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be of tremendous significance

      the Nimitz encounter with the Tic Tac proved that exotic technology that is widely thought of as the domain of science fiction actually exists.

      It is real. It isn’t the result of altered perception, someone’s lucid dream, a stray weather balloon, or swamp gas. Someone or something has crossed the technological Rubicon and has obtained what some would call the Holy Grail of aerospace engineering.’27

      They call it ‘The Admiral Wilson Memo’.

      had he just said ‘space people’? The former Director of US Navy Science and Technology Development had just told me he was read into a secret program involving crashed UFOs, alien spacecraft, possibly even aliens. I took a giddy pause to gather my thoughts. I recalled what Dr Eric Davis had claimed – that the US had so far failed to re-engineer the craft it has recovered – and then I asked, ‘Are you able to confirm to me that the US has been trying to develop recovered alien technology?’ Kobitz gave the question careful consideration. ‘Yes, I can say that’s so.’
