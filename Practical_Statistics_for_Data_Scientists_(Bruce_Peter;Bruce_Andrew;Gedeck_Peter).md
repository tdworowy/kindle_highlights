#### Practical Statistics for Data Scientists (Bruce, Peter;Bruce, Andrew;Gedeck, Peter)
      The real problem is that people want more meaning from the p-value than it contains. Here’s what we would like the p-value to convey: The probability that the result is due to chance. We hope for a low value, so we can conclude that we’ve proved something. This is how many journal editors were interpreting the p-value. But here’s what the p-value actually represents: The probability that, given a chance model, results as extreme as the observed results could occur.

      P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model. P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.
