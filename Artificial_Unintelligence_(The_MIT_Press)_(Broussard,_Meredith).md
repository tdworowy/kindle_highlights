#### Artificial Unintelligence (The MIT Press) (Broussard, Meredith)
      “All games of perfect information have an optimal value function, v*(s), which determines the outcome of the game, from every board position or state s, under perfect play by all players. These games may be solved by recursively computing the optimal value function in a search tree containing approximately bd possible sequences of moves, where b is the game’s breadth (number of legal moves per position) and d is its depth (game length).”
