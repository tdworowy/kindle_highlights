#### Eidomorphism: The Philosophy of Ontological Mathematics (Knezevic, Neven)
      Where faith does not suffice, science must fill the gap. Where science cannot suffice, philosophy must find a way. Where philosophy fails, logic and mathematics must try even harder.

      Nietzsche once said that there are no facts, only interpretations. In a way, he is correct: there are no standalone facts, but only interpretations of data with regards to some explanatory system.
