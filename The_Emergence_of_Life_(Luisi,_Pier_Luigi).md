#### The Emergence of Life (Luisi, Pier Luigi)
      Life is a potentially self-perpetuating system of linked organic reactions, catalyzed stepwise and almost isothermally by complex and specific organic catalysts which are themselves produced by the system. Bernal discusses this concept in more detail in his other books (Bernal, 1951; 1967; 1971). In jumping from Engels to Bernal, we should not forget a big name in between them, Alexander I. Oparin. The question of the origin of

      Life is a self-sustained chemical system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution.

      … run the tape again, and the first step from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cell may take twelve billion years instead of two…

      Miller filled a flask with the four gaseous components assumed by Oparin to be the constituents of prebiotic, reductive atmosphere: hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and water vapor (see Figure 2.1). By passing electrical discharges through this flask to simulate primordial lightening, he was able to witness the formation

      of several α-amino acids and other substances having biological importance (Miller, 1953).

      The main problem for understanding and possibly reproducing the origin of life lies in the control of molecular order at the level of macromolecules
