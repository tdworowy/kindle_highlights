#### THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE (ILLUSTRATED) (Nietzsche, Friedrich)
      "How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?—Even among the Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted."

      we may also say with Master Eckhardt: "The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering."

      Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things.

      The translation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, cause, end in itself, was HIS work.

      Zarathustra CREATED the most portentous error, MORALITY, consequently he should also be the first to PERCEIVE that error,

      Am I understood?... The overcoming of morality through itself—through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist through his opposite—THROUGH ME—: that is what the name Zarathustra means in my mouth."

      When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: "Could it be possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that GOD IS DEAD!"

      The hour when ye say: "What good is my pity! Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity is not a crucifixion."

      Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over an abyss. A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.

      I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.

      There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself. Lo! I show you THE LAST MAN.

      No shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.

      Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.

      To create new values—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the might of the lion do.

      Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea. Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth the world's outcast.

      The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.

      Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage—it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy body.

      Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.

      Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.

      Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit. It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.

      Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.

      Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward because I am exalted. Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities.

      Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive—so wisdom wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.

      I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.

      And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: he was the spirit of gravity—through him all things fall.

      By our best enemies we do not want to be spared, nor by those either whom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!

      Ye say it is the good cause which halloweth even war? I say unto you: it is the good war which halloweth every cause.

      Your highest thought, however, ye shall have it commanded unto you by me—and it is this: man is something that is to be surpassed.

      What warrior wisheth to be spared!

      A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: "I, the state, am the people."

      But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.

      Just see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour one another, and cannot even digest themselves.

      Ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne.—and ofttimes also the throne on filth.

      Slow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait until they know WHAT hath fallen into their depths.

      Flee into thy solitude! Thou hast lived too closely to the small and the pitiable. Flee from their invisible vengeance! Towards thee they have nothing but vengeance.

      Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the dreams of a lustful woman?

      Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in your instincts. Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with many almost a vice.

      One ought still to honour the enemy in one's friend. Canst thou go nigh unto thy friend, and not go over to him? In one's friend one shall have one's best enemy. Thou shalt be closest unto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him.

      Art thou a slave? Then thou canst not be a friend. Art thou a tyrant? Then thou canst not have friends. Far too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman. On that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knoweth only love.

      In woman's love there is injustice and blindness to all she doth not love. And even in woman's conscious love, there is still always surprise and lightning and night, along with the light. As yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats, and birds. Or at the best, cows.

      Fire of love gloweth in the names of all the virtues, and fire of wrath.

      Not only doth he lie, who speaketh contrary to his knowledge, but more so, he who speaketh contrary to his ignorance. And thus speak ye of yourselves in your intercourse, and belie your neighbour with yourselves.

      Free, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I hear of, and not that thou hast escaped from a yoke. Art thou one ENTITLED to escape from a yoke? Many a one hath cast away his final worth when he hath cast away his servitude.

      A heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a sooth-sayer, and a fool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain.

      What knoweth he of love who hath not been obliged to despise just what he loved!

      Two different things wanteth the true man: danger and diversion. Therefore wanteth he woman, as the most dangerous plaything.

      Man shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation of the warrior: all else is folly.

      In the true man there is a child hidden: it wanteth to play. Up then, ye women, and discover the child in man!

      The happiness of man is, "I will." The happiness of woman is, "He will."

      "Give me, woman, thy little truth!" said I. And thus spake the old woman: "Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!"—
