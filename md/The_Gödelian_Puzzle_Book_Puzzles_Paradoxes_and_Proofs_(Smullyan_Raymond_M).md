#### The Gödelian Puzzle Book: Puzzles, Paradoxes and Proofs (Smullyan, Raymond M.)
      “Saul Corn’s compendium of rarely used clichés.” It contains such choice items as: 1.  Half the lies they tell about me are true. 2.  These days, every Tom Dick and Harry is named “John.” 3.  I am a firm believer in optimism, because without optimism, what is there? 4.  I’m not leaving this party till I get home! 5.  If Beethoven was alive today, he would turn over in his grave! 6.  I’ll see to it that your project deserves to be funded. 7.  This book fills a long needed gap.
      A monist is one who believes that anything less than everything is nothing. 9.  A formalist is one who cannot understand a theory unless it is meaningless. 10.  The reason that I don’t believe in astrology is because I’m a Gemini.
