#### We, Programmers (Robert C. Martin Series) (Martin, Robert)
      Despite their best efforts to eliminate the need for programmers, that need has only increased and diversified. And now, they think the solution will be AI. But, trust me, the outcome will be the same. With greater power, the need for and stature of programmers can only increase.
      We love details. We revel in details. We swim upstream in rivers of details. We slog through marshes and swamplands of details. And we love it. We live for it. We work joyously hard at it. We are . . . detail managers.
      Once you understand how a difference engine works, it’s not too hard to set up surprises like that. After all, the sequence 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 42 has a set of differences that, when added forward, will reproduce that sequence. Babbage then told his guests that the machine was obeying hidden laws that he alone knew. He would go on to tell them that the “miracle” of the 42 was similar to miracles such as the parting of the Red Sea or the healing of the sick. God, you see, is a programmer who built the universe with hidden laws that only He knew.10
      Babbage was an inventor, a tinkerer, a visionary, and . . . a programmer. Unfortunately, like many of us, he allowed the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Like many of us, he was overconfident in his designs and gave little or no thought to incrementalism. Like many of us, he was easily enthralled by an idea, and was happy to think that idea 80% of the way through, but did not maintain that enthusiasm when it came to the last 20%, which requires 80% of the effort.
      The man who came up with the computer architecture combining instructions and data was Alan Turing; but it was the influence of John von Neumann that drove the adoption of that architecture.
      there are true statements in mathematics that cannot be proven by mathematics—mathematics is incomplete.
      As bad as that period was, the rebound was worse. The communists had been largely Jewish, so antisemitic horror raged, and thousands of Jews were killed, and more were raped and tortured.14 Fortunately, John survived this rampage, too.
