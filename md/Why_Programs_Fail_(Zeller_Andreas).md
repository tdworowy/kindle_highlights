#### Why Programs Fail (Zeller, Andreas)
      Not every defect results in an infection, and not every infection results in a failure. Thus, having no failures does not imply having no defects. This is the curse of testing, as pointed out by Dijkstra. Testing can only show the presence of defects, but never their absence.

      The wording of the previous example thus becomes clearer: The defect caused an infection, which caused a failureâ€”and when we saw the failure we tracked the infection, and finally found and fixed the defect.
