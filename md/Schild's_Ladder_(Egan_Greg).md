#### Schild's Ladder (Egan, Greg)
      When the means existed to transform yourself, instantly and effortlessly, into anything at all, the only way to maintain an identity was to draw your own boundaries. But once you lost the urge to keep on asking whether or not youâ€™d drawn them in the right place, you might as well have been born Homo sapiens, with no real choices at all.

      Being a singleton meant accepting that every decision had its cost, but once you understood that this state of affairs was a hard-won prize, not a plight to rail against, it gave some dignity to all but the most foolish choices.
