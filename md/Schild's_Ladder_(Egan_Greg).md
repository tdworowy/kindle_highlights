#### Schild's Ladder (Egan, Greg)
      When the means existed to transform yourself, instantly and effortlessly, into anything at all, the only way to maintain an identity was to draw your own boundaries. But once you lost the urge to keep on asking whether or not you’d drawn them in the right place, you might as well have been born Homo sapiens, with no real choices at all.

      Being a singleton meant accepting that every decision had its cost, but once you understood that this state of affairs was a hard-won prize, not a plight to rail against, it gave some dignity to all but the most foolish choices.

      Being a singleton meant that her decisions counted. She was not forced to give birth to a multitude of selves, each responding in a different way, every time she found her conscience or her judgement balanced on a knife-edge. She was not at all what Homo sapiens had actually been, but she was close to what they’d believed themselves to be for most of their history: a creature of choice, capable of doing one thing and not another.

      ‘I think everyone lives in at least two time scales: one of them fast and immediate, and too detailed to retain in anything but outline; the other slow enough to be absorbed completely. We think our memory has no gaps, we think we carry our entire past inside us, because we’re accustomed to looking back and seeing only sketches and highlights. But we all experience more than we remember.’

      By one means or another, everyone was an imperfect imitation of whatever they’d been the day before.

      Everything that happened in the universe was unique, on some level. If that were not true, there’d be no such thing as memory, or history; there’d be no meaningful chronology at all. At the same time, it was always possible to unpick some features of an event from the complicated tapestry of its context and demand that this tiny patch of reality look the same as countless others, once you knew how to orient them all for the purpose of comparison.

      But travelling is not about a change of scenery. It’s about breaking connections.’

      ‘What creates the illusion of classical mechanics is our inability to keep track of every aspect of a quantum system. If we can’t observe the whole system – if it’s too large and complex in itself, or if it’s coupled to its surroundings, making them part of the system – we lose the information that distinguishes a genuine superposition, where alternatives coexist and interact, from a classical mixture of mutually exclusive possibilities.

      Tchicaya groaned. ‘Now you’re being disingenuous. It’s a tradition, passed down from reproductive biology. Every tradition’s arbitrary. That doesn’t mean it’s empty.’

      ‘When I was ten years old, all I gave my sweetheart was a pair of projections that turned the group of rotations in four dimensions into principal bundles over the three-sphere. Ancient constructions, though I did rediscover them for myself.’
