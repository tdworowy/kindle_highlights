#### Schild's Ladder (Egan, Greg)
      When the means existed to transform yourself, instantly and effortlessly, into anything at all, the only way to maintain an identity was to draw your own boundaries. But once you lost the urge to keep on asking whether or not you’d drawn them in the right place, you might as well have been born Homo sapiens, with no real choices at all.

      Being a singleton meant accepting that every decision had its cost, but once you understood that this state of affairs was a hard-won prize, not a plight to rail against, it gave some dignity to all but the most foolish choices.

      Being a singleton meant that her decisions counted. She was not forced to give birth to a multitude of selves, each responding in a different way, every time she found her conscience or her judgement balanced on a knife-edge. She was not at all what Homo sapiens had actually been, but she was close to what they’d believed themselves to be for most of their history: a creature of choice, capable of doing one thing and not another.

      ‘I think everyone lives in at least two time scales: one of them fast and immediate, and too detailed to retain in anything but outline; the other slow enough to be absorbed completely. We think our memory has no gaps, we think we carry our entire past inside us, because we’re accustomed to looking back and seeing only sketches and highlights. But we all experience more than we remember.’

      By one means or another, everyone was an imperfect imitation of whatever they’d been the day before.

      Everything that happened in the universe was unique, on some level. If that were not true, there’d be no such thing as memory, or history; there’d be no meaningful chronology at all. At the same time, it was always possible to unpick some features of an event from the complicated tapestry of its context and demand that this tiny patch of reality look the same as countless others, once you knew how to orient them all for the purpose of comparison.

      But travelling is not about a change of scenery. It’s about breaking connections.’

      ‘What creates the illusion of classical mechanics is our inability to keep track of every aspect of a quantum system. If we can’t observe the whole system – if it’s too large and complex in itself, or if it’s coupled to its surroundings, making them part of the system – we lose the information that distinguishes a genuine superposition, where alternatives coexist and interact, from a classical mixture of mutually exclusive possibilities.

      Tchicaya groaned. ‘Now you’re being disingenuous. It’s a tradition, passed down from reproductive biology. Every tradition’s arbitrary. That doesn’t mean it’s empty.’

      ‘When I was ten years old, all I gave my sweetheart was a pair of projections that turned the group of rotations in four dimensions into principal bundles over the three-sphere. Ancient constructions, though I did rediscover them for myself.’

      ‘Everyone complains about the laws of physics, but no one does anything about them.’

      But every kind of happiness bore some imprint in the shape of the pain it had assuaged.

      Rasmah sighed. ‘You really think he’s on to something? A quantum computer can simulate any quantum process; that’s old news. It doesn’t mean that there is a quantum computer underlying anything.’  ‘No,’ Tchicaya agreed. ‘But qubit network theory doesn’t claim that. It just says that when you get to a low enough level, you have nothing left to lose by treating the system as if it were software. It’s like all the proofs in applied algorithmic theory that are based on imagining Turing machines. No one complains that the real universe is conspicuously devoid of paper tape.’

      ‘It’s beautiful, isn’t it?’ his father said. ‘This is called Schild’s ladder. All throughout geometry, all throughout physics, the same idea shows up in a thousand different guises. How do you carry something from here to there, and keep it the same? You move it step by step, keeping it parallel in the only way that makes sense. You climb Schild’s ladder.’

      ‘Whatever happens, you can always be true to yourself. But don’t expect to end up with the same inner compass as anyone else. Not unless they started beside you and climbed beside you every step of the way.’

      ‘How would we decide which features to include and which to leave out? We don’t even know the difference between their communications signals and their waste products. We’d probably come up with the equivalent of a glove puppet of a monkey that smelled exactly like human excrement.’
