#### SYSTEMANTICS. THE SYSTEMS BIBLE (Gall, John)
      basic task ofprotecting us from too much awareness, we see what we had hitherto failed to notice: that malfunction is the rule and flawless operation the exception.

      SYSTEMS OPERATE BY REDISTRIBUTING ANERGY INTO DIFFERENT FORMS AND INTO ACCUMULATIONS OF DIFFERENT SIZES

      COMPLEX SYSTEMS EXHIBIT UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR

      LARGE SYSTEM, PRODUCED BY EXPANDING THE DIMENSIONS OF A SMALLER SYSTEM, DOES NOT BEHAVE LIKE THE SMALLER SYSTEm

      SYSTEMS TEND TO MALFUNCTION CONSPICUOUSLY JUST AFTER THEIR GREATEST TRIUMPH

      PEOPLE IN SYSTEMS DO NOT DO WHAT THE SYSTEM SAYS THEY ARE DOING

      THE SYSTEM ITSELF DOES NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS IT IS DOING

      THE BIGGER THE SYSTEM, THE NARROWER AND MORE SPECIALIZED THE INTERFACE WITH INDIVIDUALS

      DESIGNERS OF SYSTEMS TEND TO DESIGN WAYS FOR THEMSELVES TO BYPASS THE SYSTEM

      ANY SYSTEM CAN BE EXPLOITED

      BIG SYSTEMS EITHER WORK ON THEIR OWN OR THEY DON’T. IF THEY DON’T, YOU CAN’T MAKE THEM

      EVEN TRYING TO BE HELPFUL IS A DELICATE AND DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING

      ADDING MANPOWER TO A LATE SOFTWARE PROJECT MAKES IT LATER

      COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT WORKS IS INVARIABLY FOUND TO HAVE EVOLVED FROM A SIMPLE SYSTEM THAT WORKED

      IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS, MALFUNCTION AND EVEN TOTAL NON-FUNCTION MAY NOT BE DETECTABLE FOR LONG PERIODS, IF EVER

      ANY LARGE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE OPERATING MOST OF THE TIME IN FAILURE MODE

      How does it work when its components aren’t working well? How does it fail? How well does it work in Failure Mode?

      WHEN A FAIL-SAFE SYSTEM FAILS, IT FAILS BY FAILING TO FAIL SAFE

      Yes, Virginia, your programwillcontain Bugs. And they will surprise you when you find them.

      IF IT DOESN’T FAIL HERE, IT WILL FAIL THERE

      ERROR CORRECTION IS WHAT WE DO

      AS SYSTEMS GROW IN SIZE AND COMPLEXITY, THEY TEND TO LOSE BASIC FUNCTIONS 71

      COLOSSAL ERRORS TEND TO ESCAPE NOTICE

      Military Systems-person reported from Vietnam, “We had to destroy the village in order to save it,”

      TOTAL SYSTEM THAT GOES INTO A RUNAWAY SEQUENCE MAY BE FORCED TO GROW OR TO DISINTEGRATE IN CHAOS

      IN SETTING UP A NEW SYSTEM, TREAD SOFTLY. YOU MAY BE DISTURBING ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING 79

      THE MESSAGE SENT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MESSAGE RECEIVED

      THE MEANING OF A COMMUNICATION IS THE BEHAVIOR THAT RESULTS

      THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU WANT. THE INFORMATION YOU WANT IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU NEED. THE INFORMATION YOU NEED IS NOT THE INFORMATION YOU CAN OBTAIN.

      IF YOU’RE NOT THERE, THE ACCIDENT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT YOU

      DESTINY IS LARGELY A SET OF UNQUESTIONED ASSUMPTIONS

      SOMETHING ISN’T WORKING, DON’T KEEP DOING IT. DO SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD

      FOR MAXIMUM SUCCESS, FEEL FREE TO SWITCH SYSTEMS AND EVEN TO SWITCH GOALS

      New Problems are created by its very presence.[a.] Once set up, it won’t Go Away; it Grows and Encroaches.[b.] It begins to do Strange and Wonderful Things[c.] and Breaks Down in Ways You Never Thought Possible.[d.] It Kicks Back, Gets In The Way and Opposes Its Own Proper Function.[e.] Your own perspective becomes distorted by being In The System.[f.] You become anxious and Push On It To Make It Work.

      The Public School System, on the other hand, although founded with the highest and most altruistic goals in mind, remains in a state of chronic failure because it violates the principle of spontaneity in human learning.

      BAD DESIGN CAN RARELY BE OVERCOME BY MORE DESIGN, WHETHER GOOD OR BAD

      Corporate Mergers represent a special case, analogous in some aspects to the welding together of two, three or more ships of differing size, purpose, and speed, and attempting to navigate the resulting product.[cvi] We confine ourselves to our earlier observation that

      WHEN EVERYTHING CORRELATES WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, THINGS WILL NEVER SETTLE DOWN

      THE FUTURE IS NO MORE PREDICTABLE NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE PAST, BUT YOU CAN AT LEAST TAKE NOTE OF TRENDS

      Catalytic Managership will only work if the System is so designed that something can actually happen—a condition that commonly is not met.

      •The molecular structure of the gene—closest thing to the true “secret of life”—was revealed through X-ray crystallography, a technique having little to do with biology. And  James Watson, who solved the puzzle, was not an X-ray crystallographer. He was not even a chemist. Furthermore, he had been refused a renewal of his research grant because his sponsors felt he wasn’t sticking to the point.

      GREAT ADVANCES DO NOT COME OUT OF SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE GREAT ADVANCES

      Pragmatically, it is generally easier to aim at changing one or a few things at a time and then work out the unexpected effects, than to go to the opposite extreme. Attempting to correct everything in one grand design is appropriately designated as Grandiosity.

      IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW HOW TO AVOID THE MOST LIKELY WAYS TO FAIL

      IF IT PUTS A WEAPON IN YOUR HAND, IT IS AIMING AT SOME KIND OF VIOLENCE

      ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE, AN INTERVENTION MUST INTRODUCE A CHANGE AT THE CORRECT LOGICAL LEVEL[cxxvi

      We cannot know all the potential behaviors of the System.

      PRIMATE PEEPER PEEPS, SEES PRIMATE PEEPING AT PRIMATE PEEPER

      IF THINGS SEEM TO BE GETTING WORSE EVEN FASTER THAN USUAL, CONSIDER THAT THE REMEDY MAY BE AT FAULT

      more succinctly: STAY OUT OF THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK TRAP

      THINGS ARE ACTING VERY STRANGELY, CONSIDER THAT YOU MAY BE IN A FEEDBACK SITUATION

      IF YOU CAN’T CHANGE THE SYSTEM, CHANGE THE FRAME—IT COMES TO THE SAME THING

      IN ORDER TO REMAIN UNCHANGED, THE SYSTEM MUST CHANGE

      CONSTANT. A feature of a System that has not yet been observed to vary. See PARAMETER (footnote k, p. 94). Formal Mathematics
