#### The Immortality Key (Muraresku, Brian C.)
      In his 2015 book, Sacred Knowledge: Psychedelics and Religious Experiences,

      “You know … we call the Eucharist the pharmakon athanasias,” he beams, using the Ancient Greek phrase for the “Drug of Immortality.”

      But according to Ruck, the true origin of Jesus’s Greek name is the root for “drug” or “poison” (ios), which supplies the Greek words for “doctor” or iatros (ἰατρός). Ruck says the “drug man.” Either way, it’s unlikely a Greek speaker of the first century AD would have heard the name Iesous and not thought of Ieso or Iaso, the Greek goddess of healing and the daughter of Asclepius, who was taught the art of drugs, incantations, and love potions by the centaur Chiron.4 It’s

      The healer from Galilee whose flesh and blood became the pharmakon athanasias, the Drug of Immortality.

      In English the line is usually translated, “That’s why so many of you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.”

      Ruck translates the Greek word koimontai (κοιμῶνται) precisely the way it’s translated elsewhere in the New Testament: “That’s why … a considerable number of you are dying.”

      Socrates in Plato’s Phaedo: “those who engage with philosophy in the right way are practicing nothing else but dying and being dead.”3
