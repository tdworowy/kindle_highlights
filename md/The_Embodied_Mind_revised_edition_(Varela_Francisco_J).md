#### The Embodied Mind, revised edition (Varela, Francisco J.)
      Biology and cognitive science were arriving at the same idea—that human cognition is not the grasping of an independent, outside world by a separate mind or self, but instead the bringing forth or enacting of a dependent world of relevance in and through embodied action.

      Although it may seem as if there is a single, abiding self that functions as the controller of the mind, cognitive science indicates that what we call “the mind” is a collection of constantly changing, emergent processes that arise within a complex system comprising the brain, the rest of the body, and the physical and social environment, and in which we find no single, abiding, and controlling self.

      The core idea of enaction is that the living body is a self-organizing system.

      Survival means that the organism must preserve the integrity of its boundaries while having constant interchange with the environment.

      We hold with Merleau-Ponty that Western scientific culture requires that we see our bodies both as physical structures and as lived, experiential structures—in short, as both “outer” and “inner,” biological and phenomenological.

      embodiment has this double sense: it encompasses both the body as a lived, experiential structure and the body as the context or milieu of cognitive mechanisms.

      “You enter the brain through the eye, march up the optic nerve, round and round the cortex, looking behind every neuron, and then before you know it, you emerge into daylight on the spike of a motor nerve impulse, scratching your head and wondering where the self is.”

      This undercurrent of restlessness, grasping, anxiety, and unsatisfactoriness that pervades experience is called Dukkha, usually translated as suffering.

      The tension between the ongoing sense of self in ordinary experience and the failure to find that self in reflection is of central importance in Buddhism—the origin of human suffering is just this tendency to grasp onto and build a sense of self, an ego, where there is none.

      We now turn to some of the categories in the Buddhist teachings called the Abhidharma.5 This term refers to a collection of texts that forms one of the three divisions of the Buddhist canon (the other two are the Vinaya, which contains ethical precepts, and the Sutras, which contain the speeches of the Buddha).

      How is it, if we have no self, that there is coherence in our lives? How is it, if we have no self, that we continue to think, feel, and act as though we had a self—endlessly seeking to enhance and defend that nonfindable, nonexperienced self?

      Sanskrit word pratityasamutpada, which literally means “dependence (pratitya) upon conditions that are variously originated (samutpada).”

      operation of the entire cyclic system. The historical formation of various patterns and trends in our lives is what Buddhists usually mean by karma. It is this accumulation that gives continuity to the sense of ego-self, so evident in everyday, unreflective life.

      Strictly speaking, though, karma is the very process of intention (volitional action) itself, the main condition in the accumulation of conditioned human experience.

      Tibetan scholar Geshe Rabten puts it thus: “The term ‘primary mind’ denotes the totality of a sensory or mental state composed of a variety of mental factors. A primary mind is like a hand whereas the mental factors are like the individual fingers, the palm, and so forth. The character of a primary mind is thus determined by its constituent mental factors.”

      Ego-self, then, is the historical pattern among moment-to-moment emergent formations.

      By nihilism we mean to refer precisely to Nietzsche’s definition: “Radical nihilism is the conviction of an absolute untenability of existence when it comes to the highest values that one recognizes.”30 In other words, the nihilistic predicament is

      What, then, is Minsky’s response to this predicament? The final paragraph of his second-to-last page is worth quoting in full: No matter that the physical world provides no room for freedom of the will: that concept is essential to our model of the mental realm. Too much of our psychology is based on it for us to ever give it up. We’re virtually forced to maintain that belief, even though we know it’s false—except, of course when we’re inspired to find the flaws in all our beliefs, whatever may be the consequence to cheerfulness and mental peace.

      Why are processes so hard to classify? In earlier times, we could usually judge machines and processes by how they transformed raw materials into finished products. But it makes no sense to speak of brains as though they manufacture thoughts the way factories make cars. The difference is that brains use processes that change themselves—and this means we cannot separate such processes from the products they produce. In particular, brains make memories, which change the ways we’ll subsequently think. The principal activities of brains are making changes in themselves. Because the whole idea of self-modifying processes is new to our experience, we cannot yet trust our commonsense judgement about such matters.8

      A system that has operational closure is one in which the results of its processes are those processes themselves.

      The key point is that such systems do not operate by representation. Instead of representing an independent world, they enact a world as a domain of distinctions that is inseparable from the structure embodied by the cognitive system.

      By progressively learning to let go of these tendencies to grasp, one can begin to appreciate that all phenomena are free of any absolute ground and that such “groundlessness” (sunyata) is the very fabric of dependent coorigination. We could make a somewhat similar point phenomenologically by saying that groundlessness is the very condition for the richly textured and interdependent world of human experience.

      The term hermeneutics originally referred to the discipline of interpreting ancient texts, but it has been extended to denote the entire phenomenon of interpretation, understood as the enactment or bringing forth of meaning from a background of understanding.

      Meaning includes patterns of embodied experience and preconceptual structures of our sensibility (i.e., our mode of perception, or orienting ourselves, and of interacting with other objects, events, or persons). These embodied patterns do not remain private or peculiar to the person who experiences them.

      Why does color have this structure? Why, for example, are hues organized into pairs that are mutually exclusive or opponent? The model of color vision that takes as its point of departure the structure of color appearance, and so attempts to answer these questions, is known as the opponent-process theory. This theory owes its origin to the research of the nineteenth-century physiologist Ewald Hering but was proposed in its modern form by Leo Hurvich and Dorothea Jameson in 1957.

      Thus color categories appear to be a panhuman, species-specific universal.

      Chicken position: The world out there has pregiven properties. These exist prior to the image that is cast on the cognitive system, whose task is to recover them appropriately (whether through symbols or global subsymbolic states).

      Egg position: The cognitive system projects its own world, and the apparent reality of this world is merely a reflection of internal laws of the system.

      Let us explain what we mean by this phrase embodied action. By using the term embodied we mean to highlight two points: first, that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individual sensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological, psychological, and cultural context.43 By using the term action we mean to emphasize once again that sensory and motor processes, perception and action, are fundamentally inseparable in lived cognition. Indeed, the two are not merely contingently linked in individuals; they have also evolved together.

      We can now give a preliminary formulation of what we mean by enaction. In a nutshell, the enactive approach consists of two points: (1) perception consists in perceptually guided action and (2) cognitive structures emerge from the recurrent sensorimotor patterns that enable action to be perceptually guided.

      “The environment (Umwelt) emerges from the world through the actualization or the being of the organism—[granted that] an organism can exist only if it succeeds in finding in the world an adequate environment.”

      Meaningful conceptual structures arise from two sources: (1) from the structured nature of bodily and social experience and (2) from our innate capacity to imaginatively project from certain well-structured aspects of bodily and interactional experience to abstract conceptual structures. Rational thought is the application of very general cognitive processes—focusing, scanning, superimposition, figure-ground reversal, etc.—to such structures.59

      A view of psychopathology fundamentally different from either the Freudian approach or object relations theory was offered by Karl Jaspers, Ludwig Binswagner, and Merleau-Ponty based on the philosophy of Heidegger.

      Pleiotropic effects are not bizarre properties of a few exceptionally complex traits. Genic interdependence expresses the straightforward fact that the genome is not a linear array of independent genes (manifesting as traits) but a highly interwoven network of multiple reciprocal effects mediated through repressors and derepressors, exons and introns, jumping genes, and even structural proteins.

      In the words of a classic text by de Beer, “It has become increasingly clear from researches in embryology that the processes whereby the structures are formed are as important as the structures themselves from the point of view of evolutionary morphology and homology.”

      The unit of evolution (at any level) is a network capable of a rich repertoire of self-organizing configurations. Under structural coupling with a medium, these configurations generate selection, an ongoing process of satisficing that triggers (but does not specify) change in the form of viable trajectories. The specific (nonunique) trajectory or mode of change of the unit of selection is the interwoven (nonoptimal) result of multiple levels of subnetworks of selected self-organized repertoires. The opposition between inner and outer causal factors is replaced by a coimplicative relation, since organism and medium mutually specify each other.

      Instead, we emphasize that the very notion of what an environment is cannot be separated from what organisms are and what they do.

      Richard Lewontin: “The organism and the environment are not actually separately determined. The environment is not a structure imposed on living beings from the outside but is in fact a creation of those beings. The environment is not an autonomous process but a reflection of the biology of the species. Just as there is no organism without an environment, so there is no environment without an organism.”25

      Genes are, then, better conceived as elements that specify what in the environment must be fixed for something to operate as a gene, that is, to be predictably correlated with a result. In every successful

      We summarized this view by saying that cognition is not representation but embodied action and that the world we cognize is not pregiven but enacted through our history of structural coupling.

      Question 1: What is cognition? Answer: Enaction: A history of structural coupling that brings forth a world.

      Question 2: How does it work? Answer: Through a network consisting of multiple levels of interconnected, sensorimotor subnetworks.

      Question 3: How do I know when a cognitive system is functioning adequately? Answer: When it becomes part of an ongoing existing world (as the young of every species do) or shapes a new one (as happens in evolutionary history).

      “Out of the local chaos of their interactions there emerges, in the eye of an observer, a coherent pattern of behavior.”49 The implementation of this

      Equally significant is that his Creatures have no central system. Instead, the layers carry out their activities on their own; the compatibility of the layers gives rise to a sense of purpose only in the eyes of the observers:

      Finally, we saw that these various forms of groundlessness are really one: organism and environment enfold into each other and unfold from one another in the fundamental circularity that is life itself.

      As Hilary Putnam incisively remarks in a recent work, “Science is wonderful at destroying metaphysical answers, but incapable of providing substitute ones. Science takes away foundations without providing a replacement. Whether we want to be there or not, science has put us in the position of having to live without foundations. It was shocking when Nietzsche said this, but today it is commonplace; our historical position—and no end to it is in sight—is that of having to philosophize without ‘foundations’.”2

      Noble Truths); the Buddha; and nirvana. Nagarjuna finally concludes, “Nothing is found that is not dependently arisen. For that reason, nothing is found that is not empty.”8

      It is important to remember the context within which these arguments are employed. Nagarjuna’s arguments fasten on psychologically real habits of mind and demonstrate their groundlessness within the context of mindfulness/awareness meditation and Abhidharma psychology.

      As is said by the Tibetan commentators, “Through ascertaining the reason—that all phenomena are dependent arisings—the extreme of annihilation (nihilism) is avoided, and realization of dependent-arising of causes and effects is gained. Through ascertaining the thesis—that all phenomena do not inherently exist—the extreme of permanence (absolutism) is avoided, and realization of the emptiness of all phenomena is gained.”10

      “‘Objects’ do not exist independently of conceptual schemes. We cut up the world into objects when we introduce one or another scheme of description. Since the objects and the signs are alike internal to the scheme of description, it is possible to say what matches what.”21

      Yet despite this thorough critique of objectivism, the argument is never turned the other way round. Mind-independent objects are challenged, but object-independent minds never are. (It is actually more obvious and psychologically easier to attack the independence of objects than of minds.)

      The interpretationists—pragmatist or otherwise—also do not challenge the groundedness of the concepts and interpretations themselves; rather, they take these as the ground on which they stand. This is far from an entre-deux and far from Madhyamaka.

      Thus Nagarjuna writes, “Ultimate truth cannot be taught apart from everyday practices. Without understanding the ultimate truth, freedom (nirvana) is not attained” (XXIV: 10).

      There is no distinction at all between the everyday world (samsara) and freedom (nirvana). There is no distinction at all between freedom and the everyday world. The range of the everyday world is the range of freedom. Between them not even the most subtle difference can be found. (XXV: 19, 20)

      Thus we can already see that nihilism is in fact deeply linked to objectivism, for nihilism is an extreme response to the collapse of what had seemed to provide a sure and absolute reference point.

      The mode of repudiation or denial that is characteristic of nihilism is actually a very subtle and refined form of objectivism: the mere absence of an objective ground is reified into an objective groundlessness that might continue to serve as an ultimate reference point.

      Nagarjuna conveys this attitude of responsiveness: Just as the grammarian makes one study grammar, A Buddha teaches according to the tolerance of his students; Some he urges to refrain from sins, others to do good, Some to rely on dualism, others on non-dualism; And to some he teaches the profound, The terrifying, the practice of enlightenment, Whose essence is emptiness that is compassion.19
