#### How to Solve It (Princeton Science Library) (Polya, G.)
      He listened to lectures, read books, tried to take in the solutions and facts presented, but there was a question that disturbed him again and again: “Yes, the solution seems to work, it appears to be correct; but how is it possible to invent such a solution? Yes, this experiment seems to work, this appears to be a fact; but how can people discover such facts? And how could I invent or discover such things by myself?”

      Studying the methods of solving problems, we perceive another face of mathematics. Yes, mathematics has two faces; it is the rigorous science of Euclid but it is also something else. Mathematics presented in the Euclidean way appears as a systematic, deductive science; but mathematics in the making appears as an experimental, inductive science. Both aspects are as old as the science of mathematics itself. But the second aspect is new in one respect; mathematics “in statu nascendi,” in the process of being invented, has never before been presented in quite this manner to the student, or to the teacher himself, or to the general public.

      “If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can’t solve: find it.”
