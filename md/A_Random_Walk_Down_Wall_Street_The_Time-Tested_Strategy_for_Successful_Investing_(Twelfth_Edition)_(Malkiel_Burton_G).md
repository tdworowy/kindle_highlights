#### A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing (Twelfth Edition) (Malkiel, Burton G.)
      Res tantum valet quantum vendi potest.

      Lord Keynes must have smiled quietly from wherever it is that economists go when they die.

      The government not only failed as a regulator of financial institutions but also contributed to the bubble by its own policies.

      Studying a longer period, Laszlo Birinyi, in his book Master Trader, has calculated that a buy-and-hold investor would have seen one dollar invested in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1900 grow to $290 by the start of 2013. Had that investor missed the best five days each year, however, that dollar investment would have been worth less than a penny in 2013. The point is that market timers risk missing the infrequent large sprints that are the big contributors to performance.
