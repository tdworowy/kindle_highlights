#### The Difference Engine (Gibson, William)
      motto of the excellent Steampunk Magazine: “Love the machine, hate the factory.” The factory might have given us the millionfold productivity increases that yielded the Industrial Revolution, but it achieved those gains by chaining us to machines, deskilling the artisan and turning him into a cog in the factory, stripped of judgment and dignity and disconnected from the rhythms of his spirit and the world around him.

      “But they can’t ever take what you know, now can they, Sybil? They can’t ever take that.”

      “How long?” “It always takes twice as long as you think,” the boy said, settling back in his chair. “Even if you double your estimate. Something of a natural law.”
