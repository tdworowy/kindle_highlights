#### The Difference Engine (Gibson, William)
      motto of the excellent Steampunk Magazine: “Love the machine, hate the factory.” The factory might have given us the millionfold productivity increases that yielded the Industrial Revolution, but it achieved those gains by chaining us to machines, deskilling the artisan and turning him into a cog in the factory, stripped of judgment and dignity and disconnected from the rhythms of his spirit and the world around him.

      “But they can’t ever take what you know, now can they, Sybil? They can’t ever take that.”

      “How long?” “It always takes twice as long as you think,” the boy said, settling back in his chair. “Even if you double your estimate. Something of a natural law.”

      “There is a wicked pretense that one has been informed. But no such thing has truly occurred! A mere slogan, an empty litany. No arguments are heard, no evidence is weighed. It isn’t news at all, only a source of amusement for idlers.” “Some might say it’s better for idlers to know

      “Some might be damned fools, then, Fraser. This kinosloganry is like printing bank-notes with no gold to back them, or writing checks on an empty account. If that is to be the level of rational discourse for the common folk, then I must say three cheers for the authority of the House of Lords.”

      It is a concatenation of synergistic interactions; the whole system is on the period-doubling route to Chaos!” “What does that mean, pray?” “Essentially,” Mallory said, smiling behind his kerchief, “in layman’s terms, it means that everything gets twice as bad, twice as fast, until everything falls completely apart!”

      Brian was still muttering, a monotone to match their tramping step. “Britain’s a sight too hospitable to all these damn foreign refugees. If I’d my way, I’d transport the lot to Texas….”

      “History works by Catastrophe! It’s the way of the world, the only way there is, has been, or ever will be. There is no history—there is only contingency!”

      The Negro nodded. He spread his open palms, gently, a gesture like a blessing. “You were right, sir, and he was quite wrong. There is nothing to history. No progress, no justice. There is nothing but random horror.”

      “As thinking beings, we may envision the universe, though we have no finite way to sum it up. The term, ‘universe,’ is not in fact a rational concept, though it is something of such utter immediacy that no thinking creature can escape a pressing knowledge of it, and indeed, an urge to know its workings, and the nature of one’s own origin within it.

      The book does prominently feature three of the foundational touchstones of all things steampunk: giant airships, brass computers, and kinky feminine underwear.
