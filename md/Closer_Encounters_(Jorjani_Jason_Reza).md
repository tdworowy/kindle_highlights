#### Closer Encounters (Jorjani, Jason Reza)
      The US Intelligence Community and the Department of Defense have officially reported that structured craft that appear to defy the laws of Physics, and that outperform anything known to be manufactured by any terrestrial nation, including the USA, have repeatedly engaged American military pilots and sailors.
      Rather, the idea is that the very nature of our Cosmos is that it is a programmable (and re-programmable) information processing system.
      The Pentagon now admits that numerous types of data have been collected on these “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena,” including gun camera video, thermal imaging, sensor readings, radar tracking, and satellite photography. This information was collected and analyzed by the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a secret UFO study group within the Department of Defense, which was headed by Luis Elizondo, a military intelligence officer.
      Finally, on December 27, 2020, President Trump signed a $2.3 trillion Coronavirus Relief and Government Funding Bill that strangely had tucked into it an order to Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Ratcliff to submit to Congress, within 180 days, an unclassified report (which could include a classified annex) that gathered together everything that the Office of Naval Intelligence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) knows about UFOs or UAP.
      Unconventional Flying Objects is a scientific book, full of equations and graphs that organize data about UFO performance with a view to identifying patterns that would allow one to deduce what kind of propulsions system, navigational principles, and metallurgical engineering could account for what has been observed.
      Our thesis is that the origins of this taboo are political. As political scientists, we are concerned with a possible connection between the need to dismiss the UFO and the way in which modern peoples organize and govern their societies. The inability to see clearly and talk rationally about UFOs seems to be a symptom of authoritative anxiety, a socially subconscious fear of what the reality of the UFO might mean for modern government.
      The sovereign identity of modern states depends on their difference from one another. Anything that required subsuming this difference into a global sovereignty would threaten the fundamental structure of these states, quite apart from the risk of physical destruction.
      Only that body who can authoritatively and effectively decide who lives and who dies, the body that can legitimately demand of citizens that they go out to die for their country in a war, or who decides that certain people must be left to die so that others can survive a certain catastrophe — only that body is sovereign.65
