#### Warbreaker (Sanderson, Brandon)
      “Mocking a woman is like drinking too much wine. It may be fun for a short time, but the hangover is hell.”

      “I try to avoid having thoughts. They lead to other thoughts, and—if you’re not careful—those lead to actions. Actions make you tired. I have this on rather good authority from someone who once read it in a book.”

      swear, my dear. Sometimes our conversations remind me of a broken sword.” She raised an eyebrow. “Sharp as hell,” Lightsong said, “but lacking a point.”

      But he’d found that imaginary things were often the only items of real substance in people’s lives.

      You’re a very difficult person to manipulate, you know.” “Nonsense,” he said. “You just have to promise me that I won’t have to do a thing, and then I’ll do anything you want.” “Anything?” “Anything that doesn’t require doing anything.” “That’s nothing, then.” “Is it?” “Yes.” “Well, that’s something!”

      “Then make something up,” he said. “I’ll never know the difference. Unknowing ignorance is preferable to informed stupidity.”

      The truth is, most people who do what you’d call ‘wrong’ do it for what they call ‘right’ reasons. Only mercenaries make any sense. We do what we’re paid to do. That’s it. Perhaps that’s why people look down on us so. We’re the only ones who don’t pretend to have higher motives.”

      Hoid looked up, smiling. “I learned it many, many years ago from a man who didn’t know who he was, Your Majesty. It was a distant place where two lands meet and gods have died. But that is unimportant.”

      condescension in your voice,” he said. Condescension?

      “My dear, have you ever known me to make an inflammatorily ridiculous statement without providing an equally ridiculous explanation to substantiate it?”

      You want to be competent? she thought. You want to learn to be in control of what goes on around you, rather than just being pushed around? Then you’ll have to learn to deal with failure.
