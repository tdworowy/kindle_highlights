#### Nietzsche (Princeton Classics) (Kaufmann, Walter A.)
      His father christened him Friedrich Wilhelm after King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, on whose birthday he was born. The king became mad a few years later, and so did Nietzsche’s father. Nietzsche later shed his middle name, along with his family’s patriotism and religion, but in January 1889 he, too, became insane.
      Every true faith is infallible inasmuch as it accomplishes what the person who has the faith hopes to find in it; but faith does not offer the least support for a proof of objective truth. Here the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth [ein Jünger der Wahrheit], then inquire.
      All things considered, I could not have endured my youth without Wagner’s music. For I was condemned to Germans. If one wants to rid oneself of an unbearable pressure, one needs hashish. Well then, I needed Wagner. Wagner is the antitoxin against everything German par excellence—a toxin, a poison, that I don’t deny. From the moment when there was a piano score of Tristan—my compliments, Herr von Bülow—I was a Wagnerian8a … older works I deemed beneath myself—still too vulgar, too “German.”
      I have somehow something like “influence.” … In the Anti-Semitic Correspondence (which is sent out only “to reliable Parteigenossen”) my name is mentioned almost in every issue. Zarathustra, “the divine man,” has charmed the anti-Semites; there is a special anti-Semitic interpretation of it which made me laugh very much [#460; cf. letter #271 to Overbeck].
      This, as it seems to me, reasonable insight into the situation I have reached after taking an immense dose of opium—from despair. But instead of thus losing my reason, I seem to have found it at long last.
      The will to a system: in a philosopher, morally speaking, a subtle corruption, a disease of the character; amorally speaking, his will to appear more stupid than he is. … I am not bigoted enough for a system—and not even for my system [XIV, 313]. What Nietzsche objects to is the failure to question one’s own assumptions.
      Thus Nietzsche is, like Plato, not a system-thinker but a problem-thinker.
      One may here recall Kierkegaard’s comment on Hegel: “If Hegel had written the whole of his Logic and then said … that it was merely an experiment in thought … then he would certainly have been the greatest thinker who had ever lived. As it is, he is merely comic.” (Journals, ed. Alexander Dru, 134.)
      For I treat deep problems as I would a cold swim—quickly into them and quickly out again. That in this way one does not get … deep enough down, that is the superstition … of the enemies of the cold water; they speak without experience [FW 381; cf. FW 322].
      Questions permitting of experiment are, to Nietzsche’s mind, those questions to which he can reply: “Versuchen wir’s!” Let us try it! Experimenting involves testing an answer by trying to live according to it.
      Nietzsche prophetically envisages himself as a madman: to have lost God means madness; and when mankind will discover that it has lost God, universal madness will break out. This apocalyptic sense of dreadful things to come hangs over Nietzsche’s thinking like a thundercloud.
      It is a matter of course with me, from instinct. I am too inquisitive, too questionable, too exuberant to stand for any gross answer. God is a gross answer, an indelicacy against us thinkers—at bottom merely a gross prohibition for us: you shall not think! [EH II 1; cf. GM III 27].
      “What differentiates us is not that we find no God—neither in history, nor in nature, nor behind nature—but that we do not feel that what has been revered as God is ‘godlike’ ” (A 47).
      To escape nihilism—which seems involved both in asserting the existence of God and thus robbing this world of ultimate significance, and also in denying God and thus robbing everything of meaning and value—that is Nietzsche’s greatest and most persistent problem.
      That one must occasionally be hard against others for the sake of the perfection of one’s own soul—though not as hard as one must be against oneself—that is a truth which was not discovered by Nietzsche.
      The revaluation is thus the alleged discovery that our morality is, by its own standards, poisonously immoral: that Christian love is the mimicry of impotent hatred; that most unselfishness is but a particularly vicious form of selfishness; and that ressentiment is at the core of our morals.
      When he had said that, his disciple shouted …: “But I believe in your cause and consider it so strong that I shall say everything, everything that I can find in my heart to say against it.” The innovator laughed …: “This kind of discipleship,” he said then, “is the best …” [FW 106].
      Go away from me and resist Zarathustra. … Perhaps he deceived you. … One repays a teacher badly, if one always remains a pupil only. Why do you not pluck at my wreath?
      The crown of Nietzsche’s philosophy is the dual vision of the overman and the eternal recurrence; its key conception is the will to power.
      The end of the moral interpretation of the world, which no longer has any sanction after it has tried to escape into some beyond, leads to nihilism. “Everything lacks meaning.” … Since Copernicus man has been rolling from the center toward “x.” … What does nihilism mean? That the highest values devaluate themselves. The goal is lacking; the answer is lacking to our “Why?” [WM 1–2]. Modern man finds that his values are worthless, that his ends do not give his life any purpose, and that his pleasures do not give him happiness.
      We are not presented with an elaborate theory of aesthetic value, but we find that the creation of beauty is envisaged as the response of a fundamentally healthy organism to the challenge of disease.
      Nietzsche’s last book, in a passage which represents an important clue to his other polemics as well: My practice of war can be summed up in four propositions. First: I only attack causes that are victorious; I may even wait until they become victorious. Second: I only attack causes against which I would not find allies, so that I stand alone—so that I compromise myself alone.—I have never taken a step publicly that did not compromise me: that is my criterion of doing right. Third: I never attack persons; I merely avail myself of the person as of a strong magnifying glass that allows one to make visible a general but creeping and elusive calamity. Thus I attacked David Strauss—more precisely, the success of a senile book with the “cultured” people in Germany: I caught this culture in the act. Thus I attacked Wagner—more precisely, the falseness, the half-couth instincts of our “culture” which mistakes the subtle for the rich, and the late for the great. Fourth: I only attack things when every personal quarrel is excluded, when any background of bad experiences is lacking. On the contrary, attack is in my case a proof of good will, sometimes even of gratitude [EH I 7].
      He maintains in effect that the gulf separating Plato from the average man is greater than the cleft between the average man and a chimpanzee.
      Most men are essentially animals, not basically different from chimpanzees—distinguished only by a potentiality that few of them realize: they can, but rarely do, rise above the beasts.
      Culture consists in the overcoming of any discrepancy between inside and outside, and the uncultured man is not really embodied in his acts, thoughts, and desires. A cleft remains in him between appearance and reality, between his nature and his true nature.
      proper destiny. Man’s task is simple: he should cease letting his “existence” be “a thoughtless accident” (1). Not only the use of the word Existenz, but the thought
      Yet Nietzsche also says in Ecce Homo: “To become what one is, one must not have the faintest notion what one is”
      “Between a clever chimpanzee and Edison, if he is considered as a technician only, there exists merely a—certainly very great—difference in degree.”2 In terms of human worth or dignity, however, this difference in degree is nil, if it is understood that human worth and dignity depend essentially on a cardinal difference between man and the animals. What is required is a goal that only man can reach.
      Nietzsche objects to the State because it appears to him as the power that intimidates man into conformity. Christianity, as he sees it, was originally a call to man not to conform, to leave father and mother, and to perfect himself.
      If the doctrines of sovereign Becoming, of the fluidity of all … species, of the lack of any cardinal distinction between man and animal—doctrines I consider true but deadly—are hurled into the people for another generation … then nobody should be surprised when … brotherhoods with the aim of robbery and exploitation of the non-brothers … will appear on the arena of the future [U II 9].
