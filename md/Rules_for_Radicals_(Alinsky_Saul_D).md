#### Rules for Radicals (Alinsky, Saul D.)
      Parts of the far left have gone so far in the political circle that they are now all but indistinguishable from the extreme right.

      “When Mr. Alinsky told us we were full of shit, that was the first time a white man has really talked to us as equals—you would never say that to us. You would always say ‘Well, I can see your point of view but I’m a little

      confused,’ and stuff like that. In other words you treat us as children.”

      The fourth rule carries within it the fifth rule: Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage.

      Three of the questions were on the philosophy and motivations of Saul Alinsky. I answered two of them incorrectly. I did not know what my philosophy or motivations were; but they did!
