#### What Is Tao? (Watts, Alan)
      And so, the secret in Taoism is to get out of one’s own way, and to learn that this pushing ourselves, instead of making us more efficient, actually interferes with everything we set about to do.

      It was well said: “The mystery of life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.”
