#### The Lost Metal (The Mistborn Saga) (Sanderson, Brandon)
      “I know her,” Marasi said. “She’s a woman of … ill repute.” “What?” Wayne said. “Who’s been saying that? Jammi has a great reputation. Of all the whores on the block, she gives the best—”

      “Wax had years to get accustomed to the depths of your depravity, Wayne. To me, it’s still remarkable how you manage to dig yourself deeper each and every time.”

      And so far there had been no greater test of his faith in humanity—serial killers included—than working with politicians.

      “And my whiskey is wearing off. Stupid body. Metabolizing and neutralizing poisons as if I didn’t dump ’em in there on purpose.”

      “A bar exists for a reason,” Wayne said. “It is a controlled environment in which to drink. People are going to seek to partake in spirits, you see, and it is better for society that we plan for this.

      Those were good stories. Super dumb, of course, but sometimes you needed cheap storytelling with your cheap booze. Didn’t make no sense to read literature while drinking outta a paper sack.

      “What even is that?” Wax asked as Marasi and Kim entered. “He called it ‘chouta.’ It’s good.” “It looks disgusting.” “Aw, mate. With street food, that’s how you know it’s good.”

      “mutants” who could sense it. How did you keep a bunch of dangerous people captive? You convinced them that they weren’t actually captives.

      “Really, I thought you’d be harder than this.” “Stop quotin’ lines from your wife last night,” she snapped, “and fight me!”

      “‘Ain’t no fellow who regretted giving it one extra shake,’” she read, “‘but you can bet every guy has regretted giving one too few.’ I can’t believe you used that quote.”
