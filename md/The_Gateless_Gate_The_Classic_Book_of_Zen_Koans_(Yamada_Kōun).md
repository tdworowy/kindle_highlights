#### The Gateless Gate: The Classic Book of Zen Koans (Yamada, Kōun)
      The entrance into Zen is the grasping of one’s essential nature. It is absolutely impossible, however, to come to a clear understanding of our essential nature by any intellectual or philosophical method. It is accomplished only by the experience of self-realization through zazen.

      It is related that the bodhisattva Manjusri was once standing at the gate, and seeing him, Shakyamuni Buddha called to him, “Manju, Manju, why don’t you come inside the gate?” Manjusri replied, “I don’t see anything outside the gate.”

      For unenlightened people, every koan is a barrier. For the enlightened person, however, there is no gate, no barrier at all. This is because the essential world is totally void. We cannot see anything there. There is neither gate nor barrier, and so-called enlightened people are those who have realized this fact.

      Mu has no meaning whatsoever. If you want to solve the problem of Mu, you must become one with it! You must forget yourself in working on it. Your consciousness must be completely absorbed in your practice of Mu.

      Mumon says, “It will be just as if you had snatched the great sword of General Kan: If you meet a Buddha, you will kill him. If you meet a patriarch, you will kill him. Though you may stand on the brink of life and death, you will enjoy the great freedom. In the six realms and the four modes of birth, you will live in the samadhi of innocent play.”

      turning word (tengo) is a word or phrase which has the power to turn delusions into enlightenment.

      There is an ancient Zen text called Believing in Mind (Shinjin-Mei), in which the line appears: “One is everything. Everything is one.”

      “Bodhidharma’s essential nature has no beard.”

      What is a fact in Zen? It is the manifestation of essential nature by an action such as standing up, sitting down, eating, drinking, crying, or laughing. In the case of Jōshū’s Mu, Mu is the fact. In the case of Gutei’s finger, raising a finger is the fact. In this case, the fact is some action of the man in the tree.

      You may ask why our essential nature is empty. Just consider what we call our mind or consciousness. Does it have any form? No. Any color? No. Any length or breadth or weight? No. Can we locate it? No, we do not know where it is. The mind has nothing. The mind is nothing. It is void and empty, and our essential nature is nothing but the boundless extension or manifestation of this ordinary mind of ours.

      While being empty, our mind has, at the same time, limitless and infinite capabilities or activities. It can see, it can hear, it can stand up, it can sit down, it can take a walk. It can feel, it can think, it can imagine, it can forget. Though void, it is limitless and infinite. Therefore, I call it the empty-infinite or the empty-limitlessness, and this is our essential nature. This constitutes the denominator of the fraction. The phenomenal world is the numerator.

      In contemplating the empty-infinite, Buddhism has two approaches, one called Hinayana and the other Mahayana. The Hinayana way is to understand that everything is empty by means of analysis. The Mahayana way is to realize that everything is substantially void by means of experience.

      One of the sutras defines a kalpa as the period of time it would take an angel who descended from heaven once every hundred years and made one sweep with its robe of feathers across the top of a cubic-mile stone mountain to wear it down level to the ground.

      The last word? Not only Tokusan and Gantō but even the Buddhas and the patriarchs themselves do not know what it is, for it is beyond perception. The last word is that which is spoken without using lips and tongue. It has no meaning. It is nothing. It is less than nothing, so to speak. But how about the first word?

      Bokushū, who always kept the door of his dokusan1 room closed. Bokushū would judge whether or not a student was ready for an interview by the sound of his footsteps as he approached the dokusan room. If he thought there was some hope, Bokushū would say, “Come in!” As soon as the student entered, the master would seize him roughly by the collar and yell, “Say it!” If the student hesitated even for a moment, Bokushū would push him out the door and slam it.

      The true practice of zazen is very severe. The present koan is a good example of this. To attain kensho (self-realization) is not so difficult; for some people only one sesshin (Zen retreat) is sufficient. But kensho is only the entrance to our final goal in doing zazen, namely the accomplishment of our character. This involves a purification which is most difficult and requires a great deal of time. There is really no end to the practice of Zen. You cannot accomplish a perfect character in forty years. Practicing a million years is still insufficient.

      There was an old Zen master who said that even the word Buddha is a stain on the clean ground of mind.

      “The Way does not belong to knowing or not-knowing. Knowing is delusion; not-knowing is a blank consciousness. When you have really reached the true Way beyond all doubt, you will find it as vast and boundless as the great empty firmament. How can it be talked about on a level of right and wrong?”

      A monk asked Unmon in all earnestness, “What is Buddha?” Unmon said, “Kanshiketsu! (a dried shit-stick)”

      It is said that there are six Buddhas who preceded Shakyamuni: (i) Vipashyin Buddha, (2) Sikhin Buddha, (3) Vishvabhu Buddha, (4) Krakucchanda Buddha, (5) Kanakamuni Buddha, and (6) Kashyapa Buddha.

      We should know that subject and object are intrinsically one. This is the most fundamental point of Buddhist teaching. It is the true satori of Zen. To intuit, experience, and realize this fact is the main reason for doing zazen.

      “Fuketsu’s activity of mind is like lightning. He gains the road and immediately walks along. But why does he rest upon the tip of the ancient one’s tongue and not cut if off? If you realize this deeply, a way will be found naturally. Just leave all words behind and say one phrase.”

      The five skandhas (aggregates or elements) are form, sensation, conception, discrimination, and awareness.

      This great occult power that Kyōzan was speaking of has nothing to do with flying around the world. It is simply eating when you are hungry, drinking when you are thirsty, and taking a rest when you are tired.

      We should know that not only are our delusions and the phenomena] world dreams, but also our enlightenment and the essential world itself are nothing but dreams.

      Some of these words deserve an explanation. The Bodhisattva Maitreya, who appeared in Mumon’s commentary on Case 5, is to be the next Buddha. He is now waiting in the Tusita Heaven and will come five billion, 670 million years after Shakyamuni’s nirvana.

      Generally speaking, people can be classified into four groups: (I) the ordinary person without enlightenment, (2) the ordinary person with enlightenment, (3) the saint without enlightenment, (4) the saint with enlightenment

      monk asked Nansen in all earnestness, “Is there any Dharma that has not been preached to the people?” Nansen said, “There is.” The monk said, “What is the Dharma which has never been preached to the people?” Nansen said, “This is not mind; this is not Buddha; this is not a thing.”

      Let us look at Case 69 of the Book of Equanimity for a moment. It reads as follows: “Once Nansen addressed the assembly, saying, ‘None of the Buddhas of the three worlds, past, present, and future, know it really is. Instead, the cat or ox knows it is.’”

      Tokusan brought his sutra commentaries and notes to the front of the hall, held up a torch and said, “Even if you have exhausted abstruse doctrine, it is like placing a hair in vast space. Even if you have learned the vital points of all the truths in the world, it is like a drop of water thrown into a big ravine.” He then burned all his commentaries and notes. After making his bows, he left.

      (1) ordinary blindness — unenlight — ened people who know nothing about the truth; (2) bad blindness — persons attached to wrong philosophies or religions; (3) blindness before enlightenment — people in right faith who are studying and practicing in the right way but are still unenlightened; (4) right blindness — the eye of great enlightenment, which sees nothing in the whole universe; (5) true blindness — the eye in which the light of enlightenment has utterly disappeared. This is Buddha’s eye.

      Master Sonnō gave him the following instruction: “Where does it come from? Even the Buddhas and patriarchs cannot tell you. If you search for ‘where,’ you will find the whole universe is the melon and that there is no tongue outside the melon. Or you will find that the whole universe is the tongue and that there is no melon outside the tongue. In the world of reality, there is neither subject nor object. The real fact transcends both mind and things. We call it the essential activity of no-thinking, which has been transmitted from Buddha to Buddha, from patriarch to patriarch. From now on you must exert yourself all the more intensely.” The monk was deeply impressed.

      Shakyamuni Buddha’s great enlightenment was simply the realization that “The whole universe is one and empty.” The truth realized by all the past, present, and future Buddhas is identical to Shakyamuni’s realization. In empty oneness there is no duality;

      Just one at every point of time and space. This oneness is sometimes called “Mu,” sometimes “the sound of one hand,” sometimes “one’s primal face before one’s parents were born,” or “the subtle Dharma,” “the subtle mind of nirvana,” “mind,” “one mind,” “Buddha,” or “our essential nature,” and so forth. All these names, however, are only symbols or labels for this empty oneness. Enlightenment is nothing other than grasping this oneness by living experience.

      “Shiki soku ze kū, kū soku ze shiki” (All phenomena are nothing but emptiness; emptiness is nothing but all phenomena).

      “You will be able to repay the four obligations above.” In Buddhism it is said that there are four grave obligations we ought to repay: to our parents, to all living beings in the world, to our sovereign, and to the three treasures (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha).

      Bodhidharma sat facing the wall. The second patriarch, standing in the snow, cut off his arm and said, “Your disciple’s mind is not yet at peace. I beg you, Master, give it rest.” Bodhidharma said, “Bring your mind to me and I will put it to rest.” The patriarch said, “I have searched for the mind but have never been able to find it.” Bodhidharma said, “I have finished putting it to rest for you.”

      Everything in the world has two aspects, one essential and the other phenomenal. In the former, everything is empty. It has no form, no color, no weight, no height. From this aspect, therefore, everything is equal. In the latter, everything is the only thing in the whole universe having color, weight, and height. From this aspect all things are completely different. All this remains the same as far as living beings are concerned. We human beings have two aspects, one essential and one phenomenal. Absolute equality and absolute difference are two aspects of one being.

      The most important point is that these two aspects are intrinsically one. For the sake of expediency, we explain them as two, but from the beginning they are one.

      There is an old Zen story which is taken to be the source of this koan. When Zen Master Shō of Setsu Prefecture was a disciple of Master Shuzan, he was asked the same question, “If you call this a shippei, you are adhering to the fact. If you don’t call this a shippei, you are opposing the fact. What will you call it?” Shō suddenly grabbed the shippei from Shuzan. Breaking it in two, he threw it on the ground and cried out, “What is this!” Shuzan shouted back, “You blind fool!” Instantly Shō awoke to great enlightenment.

      Let us look at this koan for a few minutes from two points of view, one deeper than the other. In Japanese we call them shushō-hen and hombunjō . Shushō-hen means the ascending process of Zen practice. Hombun-jō can be translated as our essential nature. Hombun means our original self.

      I was very interested to hear from one of the sisters in the zendo here that Christ uttered words that are almost identical: “To him who has, will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.” I wonder what Christ truly meant when he said that.

      There you become completely one with Mu, and there is no concept or thought whatever in your mind. This is the great death. It is also the entrance to perfect enlightenment. This stage is void of mental activity. But you must not stop there. You must press on even harder. Then the top of the stick will move forward, and suddenly a whole new world will manifest itself! This is true enlightenment. Perhaps now you understand what this warning means.

      One translation of these vows reads as follows: “Living beings are numberless, I vow to save them. Delusive passions are limitless, I vow to extinguish them. The Dharma gates are countless, I vow to master them. The Buddha’s way is unsurpassed, I vow to attain it.”

      If you go forward, you will go astray from the essence. If you go back, you oppose the principle. If you neither go forward nor back, you are a dead man breathing. Tell me now, what will you do? Make the utmost effort to attain full realization in this life! Do not abide in misery forever.

      In old China, Zen was divided into five sects, or Houses: the Rinzai, Sōtō, Unmon, Hōgen, and Igyō.

      The ancient Chinese book Gotōegen tells that Prince Nada cut off his flesh and gave it back to his mother, broke his bones and gave them back to his father, and preached the Dharma for his parents. In the same book we are told that the fifth patriarch, Konin, was born of a virgin. In a previous life, he searched for the Way, planting pine trees. In old age, he met the fourth patriarch, Dōshin, and asked to become his disciple. Dōshin refused, giving the reason that the pine tree planter was too old. The fifth patriarch borrowed the body of a young woman and had himself born again in order to meet Master Dōshin again and become his disciple.

      “Officially not even a needle can get in; privately, even a horse and carriage can go through.”

      “When one’s view equals that of his teacher, he lessens the teacher’s virtue by half; only when one’s view surpasses his teacher is he able to bring out the teacher’s teaching.”

      Penetrating Zen involves no particular cleverness: it’s just a matter of rousing the mass of doubt throughout your body, day and night, never letting up. After a long time it becomes pure and ripe, and inside and outside become one; then you become one with space, then you become one with the mountains, rivers, and earth, then you become one with the four quarters, above and below. Haven’t you heard it said “The whole earth is the student’s self; the whole earth is the gate of liberation; the whole earth is one eye of a monk.”
