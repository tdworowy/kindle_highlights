      Never trust a man who tells you good news, Reen had always said. It’s the oldest, but easiest, way to con someone.

      “The trick is to never stop looking. There’s always another secret.”

      “the entire point of life is to find ways to get others to do your work for you. Don’t you know anything about basic economics?”

      The right belief is like a good cloak, I think. If it fits you well, it keeps you warm and safe. The wrong fit, however, can suffocate.”

      “Think about it. What is a man doing when he seeks the affection of a young lady? Why, he is trying to manipulate her to regard him favorably.
