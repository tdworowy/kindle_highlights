#### UFOs (Kean, Leslie)
      In short, a group of scientists selected by the CIA advised our government to encourage all agencies within the intelligence community to influence mass media and infiltrate civilian research groups for the purpose of debunking UFOs.

      McDonald testified that no other problem within their jurisdiction compared to this one. “The scientific community, not only in this country but throughout the world, has been casually ignoring as nonsense a matter of extraordinary scientific importance.”

      Yves Sillard, unknown to most Americans, is a man of stature within the European space community. He founded what has become the world’s most effective agency investigating UFOs more than thirty years ago, and still plays a leading role in directing that agency today.

      now know for certain, that silent and completely unknown objects sometimes penetrate our airspace with flying capabilities that are impossible to replicate on Earth. And these objects appear to be operated by some kind of intelligence. The COMETA Report shows, in a straightforward manner, that the extraterrestrial hypothesis is the most rational explanation, although of course it has not been proven.

      First, it is possible to show, using data from established cases officially listed throughout the world, that UFOs—material objects—exist and are distinct from any ordinary phenomena.

      These cases are few, but their extraordinary characteristics and physical effects demonstrate this fact without ambiguity.

      On the basis of well-established cases, the existence of UFOs is without question.

      A classification was adopted that places the UAP (unidentified aerospace phenomena) in four categories: Type A: The phenomenon is fully and unambiguously identified. Type B: The nature of the phenomenon has probably been identified but some doubt remains. Type C: The phenomenon cannot be identified or classified due to insufficient data. Type D: The phenomenon cannot be explained despite precise witness accounts and good-quality evidence recovered from the scene.

      By comparing nuclear tests to some 150 visual/radar UFO cases collected since 1947, we note that the curves are practically superimposed in time and that they coincide, with not more than a few months appearing between the number of explosions and one of the UFO appearances. This similarity in the two curves would suggest that the proven presence of UFOs is related to the nuclear strategic activity in the world. I base my hypothesis on my studies of official documents, the places and zones of UFO sightings, and remarks made by highly placed civilian and military persons involved in secret programs. There have been numerous instances of UFOs flying over or near strategic air command and other military bases in the United States, especially as documented during the 1960s.

      After my many years studying the most important unexplained cases, I think we have reached a certain level of knowledge about UFOs. They seem to be artificial and controlled objects whose physical characteristics

      can be measured by our detection systems, radar in particular. They fall under a physics which is by far superior and more evolved than the one we have in our most technologically advanced countries, highlighted by the stationary and silent flights, the accelerations and speeds defying the laws of inertia, the effects on the electronic navigation or transmission systems of aircraft, and the electrical blackouts.

      These performances have been shown on radar. When military aircrafts are directly involved, these objects are able to anticipate and neutralize the maneuvers of the pilots assigned to security and defense missions, and some remarkable cases show the capacity of the UFOs to seemingly understand a particular situation or to anticipate intentions of escape or military neutralization. The UFO phenomenon is definitely related to something controlled and intelligent.

      Dr. James Harder, a University of California professor of civil engineering, told the House Science and Astronautics Committee in its 1968 hearing2: “On the basis of the data and ordinary rules of evidence, as would be applied in civil or criminal courts, the physical reality of UFOs has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”

      So what did we get? After four years and 460 pages of analysis, had we solved the UFO mystery? Well, no, we hadn’t. What we got was a comprehensive drawing together of some existing research, coupled with some exotic new theories. “That UAP exist is indisputable,” the Executive Summary states, before going on to say that no evidence has been found to suggest that they are “hostile or under any type of control.” But by its own admission, the report has not provided a definitive explanation of the phenomenon: “The study cannot offer the certainty of explanation of all UAP phenomena,” it says, leaving the door open.

      I do know one thing, without a doubt: These objects were under intelligent control.

      In summary, I am convinced that UFOs exist and are a reality that cannot remain unacknowledged by governments.

      The phenomena are evident in all parts of the world and no efforts in their study should be neglected.

      Personally, according to my best judgment, I am in agreement with the findings of the French COMETA Report: There is a high probability UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin.

      The events of that night were really amazing, and some of our simple questions have simple answers: Did the pilots see the phenomena? Yes. Did the radars spot them? Yes. Did Ozires and other military pilots see them? Yes. Did pilots in commercial aircraft see them? Yes. Do the times of the sightings correlate? Yes. Do the trajectories of the objects correlate? Yes; all of this was technically analyzed. So, did it happen? Yes, it did happen.

      Everything was spotted by both aircraft radars and the radars on the ground. On-board radars operate in a microwave band, which is very narrow, while ground radars operate in a much broader band, so there’s no risk of confusion or mistaken correlation.

      Dr. Richard C. Henry, a prominent professor of astrophysics at Johns Hopkins University, was then deputy director of NASA’s Astrophysics Division and involved in the decision-making process. In a 1988 published essay, Henry takes issue with Frosch’s claim of “an absence of tangible or physical evidence.” He says there was an abundance of relevant evidence at the time, a situation that he, as head of the Astrophysics Division, was certainly aware of.

      At the end, one of the three people from the CIA said, “This event never happened; we were never here. We’re confiscating all this data, and you are all sworn to secrecy.” “What do you think it was?” I asked the CIA person. “A UFO, and this is the first time they have over thirty minutes of radar data to go over,” he responded. They—the president’s scientific team—were very excited to get their hands on this data.

      “Well, let’s get a Twix out and advise the American public that we were visited by a UFO,”1 I suggested. “No way. If we were to tell the American public there are UFOs, they would panic,” he informed me.

      Between 8:00 and 8:30 on the evening of March 13, 1997, during my second term as governor of Arizona, I witnessed something that defied logic and challenged my reality: a massive, delta-shaped craft silently navigating over the Squaw Peak in the Phoenix Mountain preserve. A solid structure rather than an apparition, it was dramatically large, with a distinctive leading edge embedded with lights as it traveled the Arizona skies. I still don’t know what it was. As a pilot and a former Air Force officer, I can say with certainty that this craft did not resemble any man-made object I had ever seen.

      The same incident was witnessed by hundreds if not thousands of people in Arizona, and my office was at once besieged with phone calls from concerned Arizonians. Even so, I managed to keep my head down—until two months later, when a story about the sightings appeared in USA Today. Catalyzed by the article, hysteria intensified to a point that I decided to lighten the mood and add a note of levity by calling a press conference at which my chief of staff arrived in alien costume. Originally my idea, this was one my team immediately embraced with enthusiasm. Not only would it dampen any incipient panic, it would show the human face of those who hold public office.

      Yet, the reality is that UFOs are not matters of belief, but facts. Many thousands of reports worldwide describe unexplained objects in the sky. Most consist only of eyewitness testimony, which might be disregarded as unreliable—and some undoubtedly actually are—but the fact that many UFO reports come from “expert witnesses” like commercial and air force pilots, air traffic controllers, cosmonauts, and scientists should give one pause. However, some UFO reports are also corroborated by physical evidence, including scientifically analyzed photo and video images, physical ground traces affecting plants and soil, effects on aircraft, and anomalous radar tracks. In modern society, physical evidence is normally considered definitive evidence of reality, objective evidence for something that has a cause in the physical world. By this criterion, then, at least some UFOs are clearly real. The question that makes them a problem is: Could they be extraterrestrial?

      There is more than enough evidence to determine that something physical is there.
