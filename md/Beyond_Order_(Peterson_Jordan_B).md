#### Beyond Order (Peterson, Jordan B.)
      To manage complex affairs properly, it is necessary to be cold enough in vision to separate the power hungry and self-serving pseudoadvocate of the status quo from the genuine conservative; and the self-deceptive, irresponsible rebel without a cause from the truly creative. And to manage this means to separate those factors within the confines of oneâ€™s own soul, as well as among other people.

      God creates habitable chaos out of order
