#### Calling Bullshit (West, Jevin D.)
      THE WORLD IS AWASH WITH BULLSHIT, AND WE’RE DROWNING IN IT. Politicians are unconstrained by facts. Science is conducted by press release. Silicon Valley startups elevate bullshit to high art. Colleges and universities reward bullshit over analytic thought. The majority of administrative activity seems to be little more than a sophisticated exercise in the combinatorial reassembly of bullshit.

      One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted [yet] we have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, we have no theory.

      Nothing that you will learn in the course of your studies will be of the slightest possible use to you [thereafter], save only this, that if you work hard and intelligently you should be able to detect when a man is talking rot, and that, in my view, is the main, if not the sole, purpose of education.

      In one of his Socratic dialogues, Euthydemus, Plato complains that the philosophers known as the Sophists are indifferent to what is actually true and are interested only in winning arguments. In other words, they are bullshit artists.

      An important genre of bullshit known as weasel wording uses the gap between literal meaning and implicature to avoid taking responsibility for things.

      “The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than [that needed] to produce it.”

      The invention of new and various kinds of communication has given a voice and an audience to many people whose opinions would otherwise not be solicited, and who, in fact, have little else but verbal excrement to contribute to public issues.

      If you can negate a sentence and its meaning doesn’t change, it’s bullshit.

      Bullshit involves language, statistical figures, data graphics, and other forms of presentation intended to persuade or impress an audience by distracting, overwhelming, or intimidating them with a blatant disregard for truth, logical coherence, or what information is actually being conveyed.

      So I gave my lecture yesterday. Despite a lack of preparation, I spoke quite well and without hesitation, which I ascribe to the cocaine I had taken beforehand.

      Unfortunately, one of the most frequent misuses of data, particularly in the popular press, is to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship based on correlation alone.

      There is a key distinction between a probabilistic cause (A increases the chance of B in a causal manner), a sufficient cause (if A happens, B always happens), and a necessary cause (unless A happens, B can’t happen).

      Numbers are ideal vehicles for promulgating bullshit. They feel objective, but are easily manipulated to tell whatever story one desires.

      They estimate that, for one year, in people aged 15−95 years, drinking one alcoholic drink a day increases the risk of developing one of the 23 alcohol-related health problems by 0.5%, compared with not drinking at all.

      This problem is canonized in a principle known as Goodhart’s law. While Goodhart’s original formulation is a bit opaque,fn8 anthropologist Marilyn Strathern rephrased it clearly and concisely: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

      At around the same time that Goodhart proposed his law, psychologist Donald Campbell independently proposed an analogous principle: The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.

      Selection bias arises when the individuals that you sample for your study differ systematically from the population of individuals eligible for your study.

      Our friend applied one of the most important rules for spotting bullshit: If something seems too good or too bad to be true, it probably is.

      They find, indeed, that most users have fewer friends than their friends. In fact, this is the case for 93 percent of Facebook users! Mind twisting, right? These researchers found that the Facebook users have, on average, 190 friends, but their friends have, on average, about 635 friends.

      Observation selection effects explain some of what we typically attribute to bad luck. If you commute by bus on a regular basis, you have probably noticed that you often have to wait a surprisingly long time for the next bus to arrive.

      Once you start thinking about Berkson’s paradox, you’ll see it all over the place.

      This highlights one of the principles for calling bullshit that we espouse. Never assume malice or mendacity when incompetence is a sufficient explanation, and never assume incompetence when a reasonable mistake can explain things.
