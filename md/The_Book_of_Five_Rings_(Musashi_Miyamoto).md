#### The Book of Five Rings (Musashi Miyamoto)
      The principle of strategy is having one thing, to know ten thousand things.

      It will seem difficult at first, but everything is difficult at first. Bows are difficult to draw, halberds are difficult to wield;

      You should not have a favourite weapon. To become over-familiar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well. You should not copy others, but use weapons which you can handle properly. It is bad for commanders and troopers to have likes and dislikes. These are things you must learn thoroughly.

      In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness.
