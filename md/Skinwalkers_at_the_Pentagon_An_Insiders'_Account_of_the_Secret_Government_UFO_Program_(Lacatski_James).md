#### Skinwalkers at the Pentagon: An Insiders' Account of the Secret Government UFO Program (Lacatski, James)
      Meeting its deadline, the UAP Task Force released a report on June 25, 2021, confirming that the U.S. government acknowledges UAPs exist.

      Between September 2008 and December 2010, the Pentagon spent those millions investigating UAPs as well as the paranormal and psychic correlates to UAPs.

      the AAWSAP contract to evaluate the threat potential of UAPs. Throughout this book, “AAWSAP”, “BAASS” and “AAWSAP BAASS” are used interchangeably to denote close operational similarity. AAWSAP was not conceived to study projected advances in aerospace technology, except in relation to UAPs.

      AAWSAP BAASS was not AATIP. The AATIP moniker arose from an

      unclassified nickname that was inserted into a letter that was sent from Senator Harry Reid to the Deputy Secretary of Defense requesting the creation of a Special Access Program (SAP). This letter is described fully in Chapter 10. Because Lacatski, the DIA program manager, wished to protect the AAWSAP name for security reasons, AATIP was a “made up” substitute name for Reid’s letter to describe the AAWSAP.

      BAASS would like to carefully use the property it owns in the Uintah Basin of Utah and the Uintah Basin in general as a living laboratory. For more than a hundred years and especially in the last sixty-five years this area is commonly known to have frequent exhibitions of anomalous spacecraft and other objects.

      The report stated bluntly that the UAP phenomenon is a threat to human health and well-being. The AAWSAP BAASS Data Warehouse comprised many hundreds of UAP-human interactions that were classified as close encounters involving injury or death to the witness.
