#### UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook (Evi, Nemeth)
      Be conservative in what you send and liberal in what you receive. (This tenet is also known as Postel’s Law, named in honor of Jon Postel, who served as Editor of the RFC series from 1969 until his death in 1998.) Be liberal in who you hire, but fire early. Don’t use weasel words. Undergraduates are the secret superpower. You can never use too much red ink. You don’t really understand something until you’ve implemented it. It’s always time for sushi. Be willing to try something twice. Always use sudo.

      By and large, the differences among Linux distributions are not cosmically significant. In fact, it is something of a mystery why so many different distributions exist, each claiming “easy installation” and “a massive software library” as its distinguishing features. It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that people just like to make new Linux distributions.

      Traditional BIOS assumes that the boot device starts with a record called the MBR (Master Boot Record). The MBR includes both a first-stage boot loader (aka “boot block”) and a primitive disk partitioning table. The amount of space available for the boot loader is so small (less than 512 bytes) that it’s not able to do much other than load and run a second-stage boot loader.
