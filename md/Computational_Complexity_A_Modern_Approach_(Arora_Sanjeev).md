#### Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach (Arora, Sanjeev)
      the efficiency of an algorithm is to a considerable extent much more important than the technology used to execute it.

      But Chapters 19 and 20 show a surprising recent result giving strong evidence that randomness does not help speed up computation too much, in the sense that any probabilistic algorithm can be replaced with a deterministic algorithm (tossing no coins) that is almost as efficient.
