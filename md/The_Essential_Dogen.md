#### The Essential Dogen  
      And so we do not sit in order to become enlightened; we sit as an expression of enlightenment. That is what buddhas do.
      Dogen expressed this beautifully when he said, “Wisdom is seeking wisdom.” Perhaps we might paraphrase and say that wholeness is seeking wholeness, self is seeking self.
      “Your thoughts run around like a wild horse, and your feelings jump about like a monkey in the forest.”
      The ability to be fully present yet not controlled by conditions creates a stable mental and emotional foundation even in the midst of turmoil.
      “An enlightened person is someone who embodies the deep understanding of nonduality while acting in accordance with ordinary boundaries, not being bound to either realm but acting freely and harmoniously.”
      Sit solidly in samadhi and think not thinking. How do you think not thinking? Beyond thinking. This is the art of zazen. Zazen is not learning to do concentration. It is the dharma gate of great ease and joy. It is undivided practice-realization.
      Samadhi is a Sanskrit word indicating the one-pointed state of body and mind in meditation (zazen). It is translated as ding in Chinese, which means “stability.”
