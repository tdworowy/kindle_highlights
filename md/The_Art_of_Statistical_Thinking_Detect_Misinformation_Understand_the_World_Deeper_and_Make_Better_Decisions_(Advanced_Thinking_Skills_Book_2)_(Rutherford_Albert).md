#### The Art of Statistical Thinking: Detect Misinformation, Understand the World Deeper, and Make Better Decisions. (Advanced Thinking Skills Book 2) (Rutherford, Albert)
      The way we select the sample is critically important, and it depends largely on the purpose of the study or the aim of the statistical task at hand.

      A sample that is a good representation of the population can be obtained by pure random sampling.

      The average of all the squared distances from the mean is called the variance,

      The sampling distributions of the sample mean shrink around the population mean of 0, as the sample size increases. That is, as the sample size increases, the accuracy of the sample means as an estimate of the population mean gets higher. This is the fundamental property that modern statistical methods rely heavily on.

      Hence, the Z-statistic can be interpreted as a (scaled) signal-to-noise ratio: how much is the signal from the sample away from the value of μ per unit of noise. If this value is close to 0, it means the sample value is a good indicator for the population value of μ, when the sampling noise is considered. If this value is far away from 0, the sample value is a poor indicator for the population value of , when the sampling noise is considered.

      Many problems we are going to see in a later chapter, such as the correlation vs. causation,  conflict between practical importance and statistical importance, and  misinterpretation of statistics  come down to this problem. Hence, a good statistical thinker should be able to distinguish the effect size from the test statistic and make a statistical decision based on effect size in combination with the test statistic. Sounds simple, but many top-level professional statisticians often fail to do so.

      Due to its simplicity, the p-value is widely reported in many statistical reports or articles but sometimes misused or abused. For example, a low p-value can tell us the sample is not compatible with the null hypothesis, but it does not necessarily mean the effect or signal is practically large. However, it is often the case that a low p-value is misinterpreted as the indication of strong effect. The readers should be reminded that a low p-value can be associated with practically negligible effect or signal.
