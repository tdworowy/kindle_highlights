#### The Lost Way to the Good: Dionysian Platonism, Shin Buddhism, and the Shared Quest to Reconnect a Divided World (Plant, Thomas)
      Those of more postmodern bent are faced with the incoherence of setting targets for diversity of race or gender while forbidding any diversity of thought

      ; of militating for the downfall of consumer capitalism while promoting a consumerist mindset to sexuality and a proprietary approach to one’s own body; of decrying the hegemony of Western medicine while treating sexual differentiation by reproductive organs as a problem in need of surgical or pharmaceutical solutions

      of eliminating sexual binaries by binarizing body from mind and nature from culture; of arguing that gender and even sex are distinctions with no more than a socially constructed reality while professing support for women’s rights; of denouncing all social constructs yet advocating socialism; of castigating imperialism while militating to erase any cultural resistance to their own ideology. The incoherence, in short, of declaring that the default worldview should be that there is no default worldview. If no worldview is ultimately true, then why should anyone believe theirs?

      The thread that had bound Europeans to the rest of the world and to one another was, in the broadest sense, Platonism. This allowed the West to join in an endeavor, shared from Ireland to Beijing, of articulating not just physical but metaphysical reality. Medieval Christian scholars had seen truth in the works of Muslims and Jews, all of whom were working in recognizably the same Platonic framework
