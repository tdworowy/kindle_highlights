#### THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA A BOOK FOR ALL AND NONE (ILLUSTRATED) (Nietzsche, Friedrich)
      "How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?—Even among the Greeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted."

      we may also say with Master Eckhardt: "The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering."

      Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of things.

      The translation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, cause, end in itself, was HIS work.

      Zarathustra CREATED the most portentous error, MORALITY, consequently he should also be the first to PERCEIVE that error,

      Am I understood?... The overcoming of morality through itself—through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist through his opposite—THROUGH ME—: that is what the name Zarathustra means in my mouth."

      When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: "Could it be possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that GOD IS DEAD!"

      The hour when ye say: "What good is my pity! Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity is not a crucifixion."

      Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over an abyss. A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.

      I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.

      There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself. Lo! I show you THE LAST MAN.

      No shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is equal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.

      Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.

      To create new values—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the might of the lion do.

      Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea. Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth the world's outcast.

      The body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.

      Behind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage—it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy body.

      Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.

      Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.

      Of all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit. It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading idlers.

      Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh populace.

      Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward because I am exalted. Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities.

      Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive—so wisdom wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.

      I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.

      And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: he was the spirit of gravity—through him all things fall.

      By our best enemies we do not want to be spared, nor by those either whom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!

      Ye say it is the good cause which halloweth even war? I say unto you: it is the good war which halloweth every cause.

      Your highest thought, however, ye shall have it commanded unto you by me—and it is this: man is something that is to be surpassed.

      What warrior wisheth to be spared!

      A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: "I, the state, am the people."

      But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it saith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.

      Just see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour one another, and cannot even digest themselves.

      Ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne.—and ofttimes also the throne on filth.

      Slow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait until they know WHAT hath fallen into their depths.

      Flee into thy solitude! Thou hast lived too closely to the small and the pitiable. Flee from their invisible vengeance! Towards thee they have nothing but vengeance.

      Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the dreams of a lustful woman?

      Do I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in your instincts. Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with many almost a vice.

      One ought still to honour the enemy in one's friend. Canst thou go nigh unto thy friend, and not go over to him? In one's friend one shall have one's best enemy. Thou shalt be closest unto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him.

      Art thou a slave? Then thou canst not be a friend. Art thou a tyrant? Then thou canst not have friends. Far too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman. On that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knoweth only love.

      In woman's love there is injustice and blindness to all she doth not love. And even in woman's conscious love, there is still always surprise and lightning and night, along with the light. As yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats, and birds. Or at the best, cows.

      Fire of love gloweth in the names of all the virtues, and fire of wrath.

      Not only doth he lie, who speaketh contrary to his knowledge, but more so, he who speaketh contrary to his ignorance. And thus speak ye of yourselves in your intercourse, and belie your neighbour with yourselves.

      Free, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I hear of, and not that thou hast escaped from a yoke. Art thou one ENTITLED to escape from a yoke? Many a one hath cast away his final worth when he hath cast away his servitude.

      A heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a sooth-sayer, and a fool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain.

      What knoweth he of love who hath not been obliged to despise just what he loved!

      Two different things wanteth the true man: danger and diversion. Therefore wanteth he woman, as the most dangerous plaything.

      Man shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation of the warrior: all else is folly.

      In the true man there is a child hidden: it wanteth to play. Up then, ye women, and discover the child in man!

      The happiness of man is, "I will." The happiness of woman is, "He will."

      "Give me, woman, thy little truth!" said I. And thus spake the old woman: "Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!"—

      Did ye ever know this? Shared injustice is half justice. And he who can bear it, shall take the injustice upon himself!

      Marriage: so call I the will of the twain to create the one that is more than those who created it. The reverence for one another, as those exercising such a will, call I marriage.

      Had he but remained in the wilderness, and far from the good and just! Then, perhaps, would he have learned to live, and love the earth—and laughter also! Believe it, my brethren! He died too early; he himself would have disavowed his doctrine had he attained to my age! Noble enough was he to disavow!

      eyes him who maketh himself whole. A thousand paths are there which have never yet been trodden; a thousand salubrities and hidden islands of life. Unexhausted and undiscovered is still man and man's world.

      The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but also to hate his friends.

      Now do I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when ye have all denied me, will I return unto you.

      For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love, and keep modest as a giver.

      But that I may reveal my heart entirely unto you, my friends: IF there were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! THEREFORE there are no Gods.

      Since humanity came into being, man hath enjoyed himself too little: that alone, my brethren, is our original sin!

      And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him who doth not concern us at all.

      And if a friend doeth thee wrong, then say: "I forgive thee what thou hast done unto me; that thou hast done it unto THYSELF, however—how could I forgive that!"

      Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: "Even God hath his hell: it is his love for man." And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: of his pity for man hath God died."—

      And when a person goeth through fire for his teaching—what doth that prove! It is more, verily, when out of one's own burning cometh one's own teaching!

      Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them, the greatest man and the smallest man:— All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily, even the greatest found I—all-too-human!—

      And it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me, to know that life itself requireth enmity and death and torture-crosses:— But I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: What? is the rabble also NECESSARY for life? Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and filthy dreams, and maggots in the bread of life?

      Thus do I speak unto you in parable, ye who make the soul giddy, ye preachers of EQUALITY! Tarantulas are ye unto me, and secretly revengeful ones!

      But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful!

      With these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and confounded. For thus speaketh justice UNTO ME: "Men are not equal."

      But he who is hated by the people, as the wolf by the dogs—is the free spirit, the enemy of fetters, the non-adorer, the dweller in the woods.

      To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.

      For thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love only Life—and verily, most when I hate her! But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is because she remindeth me very strongly of Life!

      That delight alone he is unwilling to forego. And as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that he may have delight and power over the least of all, so doth even the greatest surrender himself, and staketh—life, for the sake of power.

      This, yea this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither endure you naked nor clothed, ye present-day men!

      But what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets lie too much?—But Zarathustra also is a poet. Believest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou believe it?"

      Belief doth not sanctify me, said he, least of all the belief in myself.

      To redeem what is past, and to transform every "It was" into "Thus would I have it!"—that only do I call redemption!

      "But why doth Zarathustra speak otherwise unto us than unto his disciples?" Zarathustra answered: "What is there to be wondered at! With hunchbacks one may well speak in a hunchbacked way!" "Very good," said the hunchback; "and with pupils one may well tell tales out of school. But why doth Zarathustra speak otherwise unto his pupils—than unto himself?"—

      Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies? Where, however, pride is wounded, there there groweth up something better than pride.

      In truth, as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise, so found I also human wickedness below the fame of it.

      For that the Superman may not lack his dragon, the superdragon that is worthy of him, there must still much warm sun glow on moist virgin forests!

      So alien are ye in your souls to what is great, that to you the Superman would be FRIGHTFUL in his goodness!

      This is thy most unpardonable obstinacy: thou hast the power, and thou wilt not rule."

      Thou goest the way to thy greatness: now hath it become thy last refuge, what was hitherto thy last danger!

      Thus spake Zarathustra to himself while ascending, comforting his heart with harsh maxims: for he was sore at heart as he had never been before.

      LOVE is the danger of the lonesomest one, love to anything, IF IT ONLY LIVE! Laughable, verily, is my folly and my modesty in love!—

      Courage, however, is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: it slayeth even death itself; for it saith: "WAS THAT life? Well! Once more!" In such speech, however, there is much sound of triumph. He who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

      "Everything straight lieth," murmured the dwarf, contemptuously. "All truth is crooked; time itself is a circle."

      This wantonness and folly did I put in place of that Will, when I taught that "In everything there is one thing impossible—rationality!"

      A little wisdom is indeed possible; but this blessed security have I found in all things, that they prefer—to DANCE on the feet of chance.

      They bite at me, because I say unto them that for small people, small virtues are necessary—and because it is hard for me to understand that small people are NECESSARY!

      There are actors without knowing it amongst them, and actors without intending it—, the genuine ones are always rare, especially the genuine actors.

      Ah, that ye understood my word: "Do ever what ye will—but first be such as CAN WILL. Love ever your neighbour as yourselves—but first be such as LOVE THEMSELVES— —Such as love with great love, such as love with great contempt!" Thus speaketh Zarathustra the godless.—

      Mine own forerunner am I among this people, mine own cockcrow in dark lanes.

      To one man, lonesomeness is the flight of the sick one; to another, it is the flight FROM the sick ones.

      I despise thy contempt; and when thou warnedst me—why didst thou not warn thyself? Out of love alone shall my contempt and my warning bird take wing; but not out of the swamp!

      With the old Deities hath it long since come to an end:—and verily, a good joyful Deity-end had they! They did not "begloom" themselves to death—that do people fabricate! On the contrary, they—LAUGHED themselves to death once on a time!

      One thing is forsakenness, another matter is lonesomeness: THAT hast thou now learned! And that amongst men thou wilt ever be wild and strange: —Wild and strange even when they love thee: for above all they want to be TREATED INDULGENTLY!

      To many that are more unknown to each other than man and woman:—and who hath fully understood HOW UNKNOWN to each other are man and woman!

      Passion for power: the glowing scourge of the hardest of the heart-hard; the cruel torture reserved for the cruellest themselves; the gloomy flame of living pyres.

      This however is my teaching: he who wisheth one day to fly, must first learn standing and walking and running and climbing and dancing:—one doth not fly into flying!

      Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived,—where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes: (That I may speak in parables and halt and stammer like the poets: and verily I am ashamed that I have still to be a poet!)
