      Otherwise, stylistic infelicities, factual errors, conceptual absurdities, and ethico-political monstrosities have been left undistubed.

      Nevertheless, he describes the Critique of Pure Reason as a time-travelling manual, although of ‘another kind’.

      AxSys. Ultimate terrestrial order. Pure Capitalism as consummate Idea of the Geostrata and concrete historical sublime. True-name for that which is really selected from the Ur-Staat by absolute occurrence (encounter with the war-machine). In its eschatalogical sense: Anthrobotic Overlord of the final dominion.

      Capitalism. Terminal configuration of terrestrial civilization, defined by sovereign axiomatics, organizing capital/cash segmentary economics and technopolitical integration. Social precursor to AxSys autonomization.

      Even though she was very tired, and seemed to be growing so young that she could scarcely hop, she carried on with her journey. Eventually she ran out of land entirely, and began to swim. This was lucky for her, because her own legs had completely shrunk away, and

      only her tail remained. Despite how far back she had come the frog-people still greeted her, laughing more than before, which was really later, or so it seemed to her then. She became so perplexed by the age of the frog-people that she called out to them: “Tell me, why are you here already, in this endless sea, with no land to hop on, or air to croak with, it makes no sense to me at all!” The frog-people continued to laugh, and pointed into the distance, where a figure was approaching from the other side. It was Bubbamu herself – grown astonishingly old – carrying as many frog-people as she could bear. ‘What a childish trick to play on myself’ she thought. ‘I must have travelled around the whole of time the other way, bringing the frog people with me. Why don’t I ever learn!?’ Bubbamu was so old by then, and also so young, that she died and was unborn at the same time, and for a moment there were only the frog-people. At least, that is what the frog-people have always said.

      They only work with seed-crops and blue-printed assembly systems, organic body-packaging by sperm-banked security drones. That’s why Nephilim genetic experimentation made you into an organism, reproduced through pyramidal genealogy, and marked by the patronymic signs of the interstellar programming-class. Dig-out the memory-chip and sim-history cuts-off into Star-god sex-abuse scenarios.

      In recent times Uranus has become the butt of infantile scatalogical humour.
