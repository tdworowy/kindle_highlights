#### Deadhouse Gates: 2 (The Malazan Book Of The Fallen)  
      People of civilized countenance made much of exposing the soft underbellies of their psyche – effete and sensitive were the brands of finer breeding. It was easy for them, safe, and that was the whole point, after all: a statement of coddled opulence that burned the throats of the poor more than any ostentatious show of wealth.

      ‘It’s a poor scholar who trusts anyone’s judgement,’ Duiker said. ‘Even and perhaps especially his own.’
      Not that he’s needed cause. I hate myself, but he hates everyone else. Which of us has lost the most?
      ‘That’s a succinct summary of humankind, I’d say. Who needs tomes and volumes of history? Children are dying. The injustices of the world hide in those three words. Quote me, Duiker, and your work’s done.’
      Why do the survivors remain anonymous – as if cursed – while the dead are revered? Why do we cling to what we lose while we ignore what we still hold? Name none of the fallen, for they stood in our place, and stand there still in each moment of our lives. Let my death hold no glory, and let me die forgotten and unknown.

But for every answer you find, a thousand new questions arise. All that we were has led us to where we are, but tells us little of where we’re going. Memories are a weight you can never shrug off.’
      only sappers know a sapper’s way of thinking and behaving, and sometimes not even them.’
      my host of deluded illusions and elusive delusions!
      And so, the simple truth … the tracks we have walked in for so long become our lives, in themselves a prison—
      this place cares nothing for us, nor are there any laws demanding that it accommodate us. Mind you, the same could be said for any world.
      The worlds live on, beyond us, countless unravelling tales.
      We are all lone souls. It pays to know humility, lest the delusion of control, of mastery, overwhelms. And indeed, we seem a species prone to that delusion, again and ever again …
      ‘Including me. An empire enforces its own necessities, makes demands in the name of duty – and that particular burden is something you, as a soldier, most certainly understand. I knew those two men very well, Kalam – a claim you cannot make. I answered a necessity I could not avoid, with reluctance, with anguish. Since that time, I have made grievous errors in judgement – and I must live with those—’
