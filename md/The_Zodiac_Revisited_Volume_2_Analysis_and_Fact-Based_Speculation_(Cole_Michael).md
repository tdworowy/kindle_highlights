#### The Zodiac Revisited, Volume 2: Analysis and Fact-Based Speculation (Cole, Michael)
      The Zodiac was a persona adopted by a serial killer. The persona existed from the time of David Faraday’s and Betty Lou Jensen’s murders, December 20, 1968, until the man killed off the persona via the Exorcist Letter in January 1974. For activity outside of these two dates, the killer was acting as himself, not as the Zodiac.

      The killer was responsible for multiple murders prior to the adoption of the Zodiac persona.

      The killer murdered Robert Domingos and Linda Edwards in Gaviota, California, on June 4, 1963. These murders were likely his first.

      The killer murdered Johnny Ray Swindle and Joyce Swindle on February 5, 1964, in San Diego, California.

      After murdering Cheri Jo Bates in Riverside, California, on October 30, 1966, the killer authored the letter titled “The Confession ” as well as the three additional notes sent six months after the crime.

      The Zodiac was responsible for all of the crimes and letters that are normally attributed to him.

      The Zodiac abducted Kathleen Johns and her infant daughter near Modesto, California, on March 22, 1970.

      The Zodiac murdered San Francisco Police Officer Richard Radetich on June 19, 1970.

      The Zodiac kidnapped and murdered Donna Lass on September 6, 1970, in South Lake Tahoe, California.

      In addition to writing the Exorcist Letter as the Zodiac, the killer also authored other 1974 missives including the Citizen Card and the Red Phantom Letter, but not as the persona of the Zodiac.

      The killer may or may not have written the SLA Postcard; I’m on the fence.

      The killer did not write the 1978 “I Am Back with You” Letter.
