#### 150 Most Famous Poems: Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman and many more (Poetry House)
      To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour.

      A truth thatâ€™s told with bad intent Beats all the lies you can invent.

      Some are born to sweet delight, Some are born to endless night.
