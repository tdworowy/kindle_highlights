#### Nietzsche and Other Buddhas: Philosophy after Comparative Philosophy (Wirth, Jason M.)
      Nietzsche did not just transform the stock of philosophical concepts. He transformed both what could count as a philosophical concept and the manner in which concepts matter.

      This vertical dimension is what the early Nishida Kitarō called junsui keiken, pure experience. This is not the experience of something but rather experience before it divides into an experiencing subject and an experienced object. It is to “see” (beyond seer and seen) the formless form and to “hear” (beyond auditor and audited) the soundless sound.

      More to the point: What does the opening of the true Dharma eye, the special transmission outside of the scriptures that does not rest on words or letters, to turn a sutra into a Dharma eyeball, have to do with comparative philosophy? This is the question that ultimately guides this book.

      It is not virtue that makes us happy but rather happiness that makes us virtuous.

      I reached the end of reason, reached the limit of words, reached the end of all human skill or ability. Ordinary mental processes, consciousness, and emotions all ceased to function. It was as though I was encased in a sheet of ice ten thousand feet thick or sitting inside a bottle of pure crystal. My breath itself seemed to hang suspended. Then, in the middle of the night, a wonderful thing happened. As the sound of a distant bell reached my ears, I suddenly broke through into great enlightenment. It was mind and body falling away; fallen away mind and body. . . . The great earth completely and utterly vanished. Not a particle remained. (HP, 25–26)

      “Emptiness misunderstood destroys the slow-witted, like a serpent wrongly held or a spell wrongly executed

      Schopenhauer grabbed the serpent of emptiness by the head and received a mighty dose of its venom. Zarathustra bit its head off and that made all the difference.

      Japan had imported a dead god without importing the critical awareness of its demise.

      Zarathustra warns his would-be followers: “Go forth from me and defend yourselves against Zarathustra. And better yet: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he deceived you”

      Dōgen’s claim (in the Shōbōgenzō fascicle Shōji) that nirvāṛa is not the escape from saṃsāra but rather that saṃsāra rightly grasped is nirvāṇa.

      “No one can live a genuine life except through death. Living in death, acting as one who has died, becomes the way to true life”

      Nihilism. It is ambiguous: Nihilism as symptom of the enhanced power of the spirit: active nihilism. Nihilism as the decline and regression of the power of the spirit: passive nihilism. Friedrich Nietzsche, Werke in Drei Bänden, ed. Karl Schlechta (Munich: Carl Hanser, 1956), 557.

      For Nietzsche, Silke-Maria Weineck argues, “No defecation, no philosophy. Those who write before they digest are worthy of only scorn.”9
