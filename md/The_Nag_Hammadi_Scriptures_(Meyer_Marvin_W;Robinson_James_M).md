#### The Nag Hammadi Scriptures (Meyer, Marvin W.;Robinson, James M.)
      Jesus of infinite sweetness.17

      For the Father’s children [34] are his fragrance; they are from the beauty of his face. The Father loves his fragrance and disperses it everywhere,

      Sometimes the evil order begins, in a foolish fashion, to work some evil, and the <wise> order emulates it in the shape of a malefactor, it too doing evil as if it were a power of evil. At other times the wise order sets out to do good, and the <foolish> order emulates it so as to do the same.

      The first ruler defiled Eve and produced in her two sons, a first and a second: Elohim and Yahweh.

      (1) Jesus said, “Whoever blasphemes against the Father will be forgiven, (2) and whoever blasphemes against the Son will be forgiven, (3) but whoever blasphemes against the holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either on earth or in heaven.”

      Jesus said, “I shall destroy [this] house, and no one will be able to build it [again].”

      (1) Jesus said, “I am the light that is over all things.144 I am all: from me all has come forth, and to me all has reached.145 (2) Split a piece of wood; I am there. (3) Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.”

      Jesus said, “The Father’s kingdom is like a person who wanted to put someone powerful to death. (2) While at home he drew his sword and thrust it into the wall to find out whether his hand would go in. (3) Then he killed the powerful one.”

      (1) “Whoever does not hate [father] and mother as I do cannot be a [disciple] of me, (2) and whoever does [not] love [father and] mother as I do cannot be a [disciple of] me. (3) For my mother [gave me [50] falsehood],176 but my true [mother]177 gave me life.”

      There are two trees growing in paradise. One produces [animals] and the other produces people. Adam [ate] of the tree that produces animals, and [he] became an animal and brought forth animals. As a result Adam’s children worship animals.91

      “If you wish to see the nature of this mystery,2 consider the marvelous image of sexual intercourse between male and female. For when the male reaches his climax, the semen is ejaculated. At that moment the female receives the strength of the male and the male receives the strength of the female, as the semen does this.

      The winds, which are demons from water, fire, darkness, and light, had intercourse unto perdition. Through their intercourse the winds received in their womb foam from the penis of the demons, and they conceived a power in their vulva through inhalation.

      Moses was a joke, called a faithful servant51 and friend.52 The testimony about him was wrong, since he never knew me. He did not know me, and none of those before him, from Adam to Moses and John the Baptizer, knew me or [64] my siblings. They had instruction from angels to observe food laws and submit to bitter slavery. They never knew truth and they never will, because their souls are enslaved and they can never find a mind with freedom to know, until they come to know the Son of Humanity. On account of my Father, I was the one the world did not know, and for this reason it rose up against me and my siblings. But we are blameless toward it; we have not sinned.

      In addition, I will say something more important. The mind, in terms of its actual being, is in a place, which means it is in the body. But in terms of the thought process, the mind is not in a place. For how can it be in a place when it contemplates every place?

      Entrust yourself to God alone, both as father and as friend. For everyone goes about in deceit. The whole earth is full of suffering and pain, things in which there is no profit. If you wish to lead your life in tranquility, do not keep company with anyone. Even if you do keep company with them, be as if you do not. Be pleasing to God, and you will not need anyone.

      For he168 it is who dwells in every place and in no place. For no one who wants to can know God as he is,169 not even Christ or the Spirit, or the chorus of angels, or the archangels [117], together with the thrones of the spirits, and exalted lordships, and the “great mind.”170 If you do not know yourself,171 you will not be able to know any of these.

      Put all words to the test before you utter them.

      The upward progression from Autogenes to Protophanes to Kalyptos is the progression from sequential discursive thought, to a simultaneous union of knowing subject and known object, to the total awareness or direct intuition of pure being.

      The glories are perfect living concepts; it is [im]possible that they perish, because [they are] patterns of salvation—that is to say, anyone receiving them will be rescued to them.

      Gamaliel and Strempsouchos; Akramas and Loel, and Mnesinous [are] immortal spirits; Yesseus [M]azareu[s] Ye[s]sedekeus is [the commander]

      “The [Invisible] Spirit [is] a psychic and intellectual power, a knower and a foreknower. Therefore he is mediated by [Ga]briel the spirit-giver, [so that] when he gives a holy spirit, he might seal one with the crown and crown him, as though [he has] gods and [59].......

      For they are [triple] powers of his [unity],77 [complete] Existence, Life, and Blessedness. In Existence he exists [as] a simple unity,

      “And…[117] he stands.96 It is there that all living creatures are, existing individually, although unified. The knowledge of the knowledge is there as well as a basis for ignorance. Chaos is there as well as a [place] for all of them, it being [complete] while they are incomplete. True light is there, as well as enlightened darkness together with that which truly is nonexistent, that [which] is not truly existent, [as well as] the nonexistent ones that are not at all.97 But he <is> the [Good] from which derives what is good and pleasant, even the god from [whom] derives the divine as well as that which [is beyond divine], that which is great.98 “For [there is nothing] partial; [there is no] form together with the god [of that one] and that [which is superior to] god…all these…guilessness…[118] and genus.

      “He possesses [three] within one, which [makes four. The one who] also dominates the…dwelling upon…[126] ten thousand–fold.
