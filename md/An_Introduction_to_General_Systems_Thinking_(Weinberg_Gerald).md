#### An Introduction to General Systems Thinking (Weinberg, Gerald)
      The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them. - Albert Einstein

      Or to say it another way, you can catch phenomena in a logical box or in a mathematical box. The logical box is coarse but strong. The mathematical box is fine grained but flimsy. The mathematical box is a beautiful way of wrapping up a problem, but it will not hold the phenomena unless they have been caught in a logical box to begin with. - John R. Platt1

      It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so. - Will Rogers

      The general systems movement has taken up the task of helping scientists unravel complexity, technologists to master it, and others to learn to live with it.

      Physics does not endeavor to explain nature. In fact, the great success of physics is due to a restriction of its objectives: it endeavors to explain the regularities in the behavior of objects. This renunciation of the broader aim, and the specification of the domain for which an explanation can be sought, now appears to us an obvious necessity. In fact, the specification of the explainable may have been the greatest discovery of physics so far. The regularities in the phenomena which physical science endeavors to uncover are called the laws of nature. The name is actually very appropriate. Just as legal laws regulate actions and behavior under certain conditions but do not try to regulate all actions and behavior, the laws of physics also determine the behavior of its objects of interest only under certain well-defined conditions but leave much freedom otherwise.3 - Eugene P. Wigner

      if neither of the bodies is present—the "field" equation. Altogether, the most general two-body system requires four equations: two "isolated" equations, one "interaction" equation, and one "field" equation.

      How much effort is involved in solving equations, and why are we so interested in the question? In Newton's day, the impact of mechanics on philosophical thought was pervasive. Many philosophers thought, with Laplace, that given precise observations on the position and velocity of every particle of matter, one could calculate the entire future of the universe. Although they realized that they would need a large computing machine, they lacked even the smallest computers. How could they possibly put a measure on the required computation?

      But Newton went even further than this, for he observed that the dominant mass of the sun enabled him to consider each planet together with the sun as a separate system from each of the others. Such a separation of a system into noninteracting subsystems is an extremely important technique known to all developed sciences—and to systems theorists as well.

      Newton's genius was, on the contrary, his ability to simplify, idealize, and streamline the world so that it became, in some measure, tractable to the brains of perfectly ordinary men. By studying the methods of simplification that have succeeded and failed in the past, we

      Region I is the region that might be called "organized simplicity"—the region of machines, or mechanisms. Region II is the region of "unorganized complexity"—the region of populations, or aggregates, as we shall call them. Region III, the yawning gap in the middle, is the region of "organized complexity"—the region too complex for analysis and too organized for statistics. This is the region of systems.

      For medium number systems, we can expect that large fluctuations, irregularities, and discrepancy with any theory will occur more or less regularly.

      The general systems movement itself, of course, is subject to the same abuses if it carries its principles beyond their useful limits. General systems thinking is not going to yield the kinds of control over medium number systems that we might imagine we would like to have, and its major contribution is most likely to be in limiting the excesses of other approaches to complexity.

      "Science" as Science The misnaming of fields of study is so common as to lead to what might be general systems laws. For example, the mathematician, Frank Harary, once suggested this "law" to me: Any field with the word "science" in its name is guaranteed not to be a science. He would cite as examples Military Science, Library Science, Political Science, Homemaking Science, Social Science, and Computer Science. Discuss the generality of this law, and possible reasons for its predictive power.

      Every model is ultimately the expression of one thing we think we hope to understand in terms of another thing we think we do understand. The chain of reasoning may be a hundred logical steps or a single analogical leap, but always ends in terms of some primitives we agree among ourselves not to question further.

      Science is the study of those things that can be reduced to the study of other things.

      Conceptual schemes are also found, however, in any subculture that develops when people work together. By possessing a common set of standard categories of thought—usually symbolized by special words or phrases—groups can simplify the process of internal communication. Paradoxically, the more effective these categories are for internal communication, the more difficult they make communication with outsiders.

      Because of the importance of category systems in a social group, it is not the outsider with a "better" system who becomes king, but the insider who most thoroughly masters the internal system.

      As Reichenbach11 said: We need (induction) if we want to establish a general truth, which includes a reference to unobserved things, and because we need it, we are willing to take the risk of error.

      Even the most renaissance of renaissance men in these days cannot hope to know more than a very small fraction of what is known by somebody. The general systems man, therefore, is constantly taking leaps in the dark, constantly jumping to conclusions on insufficient evidence, constantly, in fact, making a fool of himself. Indeed, the willingness to make a fool of oneself should almost be a requirement for admission to the Society for General Systems Research, for this willingness is almost a prerequisite to rapid learning.12 To be a successful generalist, then, we must approach

      To be a successful generalist, one must study the art of ignoring data and of seeing only the "mere outlines" of things.

      It will be objected that this sharpness or clarity involves certain distortions or misrepresentations, depending on over-simplifications. But this is the perennial dilemma of the teacher: the teaching of facts and figures vs. the teaching of truth. To convey a model the teacher must reify and diagram and declare clearly what cannot be seen at all. The student must "learn" things in order to realize subsequently that they are not quite the way he learned them. But by that time he will have gotten into the spirit of the matter, and from this he may arrive at some approximation of the truth, an approximation he will continue to revise all his life long.16 - Karl Menninger

      When the facts contradict the law, reject the facts or change the definitions, but never throw away the law. This could be called The Law of Conservation of Laws.

      Any general law must have at least two specific applications.

      The Composition Law, which goes back at least to Aristotle, says: The whole is more than the sum of its parts. The Decomposition Law, on the other hand, says: The part is more than a fraction of the whole.

      Because of the nature of general systems laws, the content transferred may actually be quite small, from the economist's point of view. Nevertheless, the generalist is already at an advantage over his colleagues because, like the tourist in Bangkok, he is not afraid of the unfamiliar. He has named the beast, and he has thus begun to tame it.

      The real world gives the subset of what is; the product space represents the uncertainty of the observer. The product space may therefore change if the observer changes; and two observers may legitimately use different product spaces within which to record the same subset of actual events in some actual thing. The "constraint" is thus a relation between observer and thing; the properties of any particular constraint will depend on both the real thing and on the observer. It follows that a substantial part of the theory of organization will be concerned with properties that are not intrinsic to the thing but are relational between observer and thing. - W. Ross Ashby1

      What is a system? As any poet knows,  a system is a way of looking at the world.

      The system is a point of view—natural for a poet, yet terrifying for a scientist!

      At this point, the "realists" in such a discussion will quote Einstein: The belief in an external world independent of the percipient subject is the foundation of all science.4
