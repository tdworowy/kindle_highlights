#### An Introduction to General Systems Thinking (Weinberg, Gerald)
      The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them. - Albert Einstein

      Or to say it another way, you can catch phenomena in a logical box or in a mathematical box. The logical box is coarse but strong. The mathematical box is fine grained but flimsy. The mathematical box is a beautiful way of wrapping up a problem, but it will not hold the phenomena unless they have been caught in a logical box to begin with. - John R. Platt1

      It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so. - Will Rogers

      The general systems movement has taken up the task of helping scientists unravel complexity, technologists to master it, and others to learn to live with it.

      Physics does not endeavor to explain nature. In fact, the great success of physics is due to a restriction of its objectives: it endeavors to explain the regularities in the behavior of objects. This renunciation of the broader aim, and the specification of the domain for which an explanation can be sought, now appears to us an obvious necessity. In fact, the specification of the explainable may have been the greatest discovery of physics so far. The regularities in the phenomena which physical science endeavors to uncover are called the laws of nature. The name is actually very appropriate. Just as legal laws regulate actions and behavior under certain conditions but do not try to regulate all actions and behavior, the laws of physics also determine the behavior of its objects of interest only under certain well-defined conditions but leave much freedom otherwise.3 - Eugene P. Wigner

      if neither of the bodies is present—the "field" equation. Altogether, the most general two-body system requires four equations: two "isolated" equations, one "interaction" equation, and one "field" equation.

      How much effort is involved in solving equations, and why are we so interested in the question? In Newton's day, the impact of mechanics on philosophical thought was pervasive. Many philosophers thought, with Laplace, that given precise observations on the position and velocity of every particle of matter, one could calculate the entire future of the universe. Although they realized that they would need a large computing machine, they lacked even the smallest computers. How could they possibly put a measure on the required computation?

      But Newton went even further than this, for he observed that the dominant mass of the sun enabled him to consider each planet together with the sun as a separate system from each of the others. Such a separation of a system into noninteracting subsystems is an extremely important technique known to all developed sciences—and to systems theorists as well.

      Newton's genius was, on the contrary, his ability to simplify, idealize, and streamline the world so that it became, in some measure, tractable to the brains of perfectly ordinary men. By studying the methods of simplification that have succeeded and failed in the past, we

      Region I is the region that might be called "organized simplicity"—the region of machines, or mechanisms. Region II is the region of "unorganized complexity"—the region of populations, or aggregates, as we shall call them. Region III, the yawning gap in the middle, is the region of "organized complexity"—the region too complex for analysis and too organized for statistics. This is the region of systems.

      For medium number systems, we can expect that large fluctuations, irregularities, and discrepancy with any theory will occur more or less regularly.
