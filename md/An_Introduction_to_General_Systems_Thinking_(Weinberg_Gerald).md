#### An Introduction to General Systems Thinking (Weinberg, Gerald)
      The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them. - Albert Einstein

      Or to say it another way, you can catch phenomena in a logical box or in a mathematical box. The logical box is coarse but strong. The mathematical box is fine grained but flimsy. The mathematical box is a beautiful way of wrapping up a problem, but it will not hold the phenomena unless they have been caught in a logical box to begin with. - John R. Platt1

      It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's what we know that ain't so. - Will Rogers

      The general systems movement has taken up the task of helping scientists unravel complexity, technologists to master it, and others to learn to live with it.

      Physics does not endeavor to explain nature. In fact, the great success of physics is due to a restriction of its objectives: it endeavors to explain the regularities in the behavior of objects. This renunciation of the broader aim, and the specification of the domain for which an explanation can be sought, now appears to us an obvious necessity. In fact, the specification of the explainable may have been the greatest discovery of physics so far. The regularities in the phenomena which physical science endeavors to uncover are called the laws of nature. The name is actually very appropriate. Just as legal laws regulate actions and behavior under certain conditions but do not try to regulate all actions and behavior, the laws of physics also determine the behavior of its objects of interest only under certain well-defined conditions but leave much freedom otherwise.3 - Eugene P. Wigner

      if neither of the bodies is present—the "field" equation. Altogether, the most general two-body system requires four equations: two "isolated" equations, one "interaction" equation, and one "field" equation.

      How much effort is involved in solving equations, and why are we so interested in the question? In Newton's day, the impact of mechanics on philosophical thought was pervasive. Many philosophers thought, with Laplace, that given precise observations on the position and velocity of every particle of matter, one could calculate the entire future of the universe. Although they realized that they would need a large computing machine, they lacked even the smallest computers. How could they possibly put a measure on the required computation?

      But Newton went even further than this, for he observed that the dominant mass of the sun enabled him to consider each planet together with the sun as a separate system from each of the others. Such a separation of a system into noninteracting subsystems is an extremely important technique known to all developed sciences—and to systems theorists as well.

      Newton's genius was, on the contrary, his ability to simplify, idealize, and streamline the world so that it became, in some measure, tractable to the brains of perfectly ordinary men. By studying the methods of simplification that have succeeded and failed in the past, we

      Region I is the region that might be called "organized simplicity"—the region of machines, or mechanisms. Region II is the region of "unorganized complexity"—the region of populations, or aggregates, as we shall call them. Region III, the yawning gap in the middle, is the region of "organized complexity"—the region too complex for analysis and too organized for statistics. This is the region of systems.

      For medium number systems, we can expect that large fluctuations, irregularities, and discrepancy with any theory will occur more or less regularly.

      The general systems movement itself, of course, is subject to the same abuses if it carries its principles beyond their useful limits. General systems thinking is not going to yield the kinds of control over medium number systems that we might imagine we would like to have, and its major contribution is most likely to be in limiting the excesses of other approaches to complexity.

      "Science" as Science The misnaming of fields of study is so common as to lead to what might be general systems laws. For example, the mathematician, Frank Harary, once suggested this "law" to me: Any field with the word "science" in its name is guaranteed not to be a science. He would cite as examples Military Science, Library Science, Political Science, Homemaking Science, Social Science, and Computer Science. Discuss the generality of this law, and possible reasons for its predictive power.

      Every model is ultimately the expression of one thing we think we hope to understand in terms of another thing we think we do understand. The chain of reasoning may be a hundred logical steps or a single analogical leap, but always ends in terms of some primitives we agree among ourselves not to question further.

      Science is the study of those things that can be reduced to the study of other things.

      Conceptual schemes are also found, however, in any subculture that develops when people work together. By possessing a common set of standard categories of thought—usually symbolized by special words or phrases—groups can simplify the process of internal communication. Paradoxically, the more effective these categories are for internal communication, the more difficult they make communication with outsiders.

      Because of the importance of category systems in a social group, it is not the outsider with a "better" system who becomes king, but the insider who most thoroughly masters the internal system.

      As Reichenbach11 said: We need (induction) if we want to establish a general truth, which includes a reference to unobserved things, and because we need it, we are willing to take the risk of error.

      Even the most renaissance of renaissance men in these days cannot hope to know more than a very small fraction of what is known by somebody. The general systems man, therefore, is constantly taking leaps in the dark, constantly jumping to conclusions on insufficient evidence, constantly, in fact, making a fool of himself. Indeed, the willingness to make a fool of oneself should almost be a requirement for admission to the Society for General Systems Research, for this willingness is almost a prerequisite to rapid learning.12 To be a successful generalist, then, we must approach

      To be a successful generalist, one must study the art of ignoring data and of seeing only the "mere outlines" of things.

      It will be objected that this sharpness or clarity involves certain distortions or misrepresentations, depending on over-simplifications. But this is the perennial dilemma of the teacher: the teaching of facts and figures vs. the teaching of truth. To convey a model the teacher must reify and diagram and declare clearly what cannot be seen at all. The student must "learn" things in order to realize subsequently that they are not quite the way he learned them. But by that time he will have gotten into the spirit of the matter, and from this he may arrive at some approximation of the truth, an approximation he will continue to revise all his life long.16 - Karl Menninger

      When the facts contradict the law, reject the facts or change the definitions, but never throw away the law. This could be called The Law of Conservation of Laws.

      Any general law must have at least two specific applications.

      Any general law is bound to have at least two exceptions.

      The Composition Law, which goes back at least to Aristotle, says: The whole is more than the sum of its parts. The Decomposition Law, on the other hand, says: The part is more than a fraction of the whole.

      Because of the nature of general systems laws, the content transferred may actually be quite small, from the economist's point of view. Nevertheless, the generalist is already at an advantage over his colleagues because, like the tourist in Bangkok, he is not afraid of the unfamiliar. He has named the beast, and he has thus begun to tame it.

      The real world gives the subset of what is; the product space represents the uncertainty of the observer. The product space may therefore change if the observer changes; and two observers may legitimately use different product spaces within which to record the same subset of actual events in some actual thing. The "constraint" is thus a relation between observer and thing; the properties of any particular constraint will depend on both the real thing and on the observer. It follows that a substantial part of the theory of organization will be concerned with properties that are not intrinsic to the thing but are relational between observer and thing. - W. Ross Ashby1

      What is a system? As any poet knows,  a system is a way of looking at the world.

      The system is a point of view—natural for a poet, yet terrifying for a scientist!

      At this point, the "realists" in such a discussion will quote Einstein: The belief in an external world independent of the percipient subject is the foundation of all science.4

      Heuristic devices don't tell you when to stop.

      Systems are thoroughly man-made... When we include a given relation in a system, or omit it, we may do well or ill; but such an inclusion creates no truth, and such omission indicates no falsity. The justification for one's procedure, in this respect, is purely pragmatic; it depends upon the relevance of what is included or omitted to the purposes which the system is designed to satisfy,9

      More often than not, the classes of objects encountered in the real physical world do not have precisely defined criteria of membership.10 - L. A. Zadeh

      Arbitrary systems: Systems about which nothing general can be said, except that "nothing general can be said."

      A system is a set of objects together with relationships between the objects and between their attributes.

      Computers have a way of exposing flaws in explicit rules. In the attempt to mechanize a classification procedure, we usually discover much more than meets the eye.

      TIME FLIES LIKE AN ARROW, is not the same as the structure of FRUIT FLIES LIKE A BANANA. The answer is that we do not know. We jumped to a conclusion based on a probable semantic interpretation.

      As Bertrand Russell remarked, mathematics gets its appearance of truth from not saying what it is talking about.

      A mathematical argument cannot be true or false, but, as the mathematician says, only "valid" or "invalid." "Valid," in effect, means that it is internally consistent.

      We may state this idea in the form of a Principle of Indifference: Laws should not depend on a particular choice of notation.

      A is said to be consistent with B if he never gives two different symbols for one of B's symbols.

      Notice, however, that the concept of super-superobserver is much like the concept of "reality," in that it contains "all possible" observations. Put in these terms, we see that the concept of "reality" is very close to what some people call "God."

      To a certain extent, mental power can compensate for observational weakness.

      When asked, for example, what happens to two blocks of copper initially at different temperatures left alone together in an insulated container, they will all reply that the blocks will come to the same temperature. Of course, if asked how they know, they usually say "Because it is a law of nature."... the opposite is true ... it is a law of nature because it happens." - John R. Dixon and Alden H. Emery, Jr.4

      The Generalized Thermodynamic Law: More probable states are more likely to be observed than less probable states, unless specific constraints exist to keep them from occurring.

      The things we see more frequently are more frequent: 1. because there is some physical reason to favor certain states (the First Law) or 2. because there is some mental reason (the Second Law).

      If we want to learn anything, we mustn't try to learn everything.

      And if theologians saw every miracle as a miracle, there would be no religion, because every miracle belongs to the set of all miracles, and thus is not entirely unique.

      By means of mathematics we purchase a great ease of manipulation at the cost of a certain loss of complexity of content. If we ever forget this cost, and it is easy for it to fall to the back of our minds, then the very ease with which we manipulate symbols may be our undoing. All I am saying is that mathematics in any of its applied fields is a wonderful servant but a very bad master; it is so good a servant that there is a tendency for it to become an unjust steward and usurp the master's place. - Kenneth Boulding7

      If observer B dominated observer A, every observation A could make could be predicted from the corresponding observation of B. In other words: A = f(B)

      That is, no matter how we select among isomorphs, or decompose into more refined views, nothing essentially new will be found.

      ... the notion of complementarity simply characterizes the answers we can receive by such inquiry, whenever the interaction between the measuring instruments and the objects forms an integral part of the phenomena.

      These are the essential ingredients in our idea of complementarity: two mutually irreducible points of view that are not entirely independent.

      General Law of Complementarity: Any two points of view are complementary.

      Reductionism is an article of scientific faith. It must be faith, for nobody has ever observed the final reduction of any set of observations. We may scoff all we like at the "nonscientific"

      If we make elaborate measurements precise enough to determine the microscopic state of a system at a given instant, we can indeed find out what the state is but the disturbance engendered (for instance by the breaking of chemical bonds) would be so radical that the system would behave thereafter in a quite different way from the way it did before; it can no longer be considered as the same dynamical system. , . . We have killed the organism by our too detailed measurements.16

      In general, in a system with one long cycle that has factors (such as 180 = 5 x 4 x 9), we may be able to reduce the number of pairs remembered to the sum of the factors: 5 + 4 + 9 = 18. Consider a very long cycle of 1010 states. 1010 is the product of 10 tens, while the sum of 10 tens is only 100, or 102. Thus, if we can break down the system into ten independent cycles, we have made a reduction of 1010/102 = 108. While most of us can (with effort) memorize a list of 100 pairs, how many could memorize ten billion?

      Principle of Difference: Laws should not depend on a particular choice of symbols, but they usually do.

      1. get a "complete" view—one broad enough to encompass all phenomena of interest—so we are not surprised; 2. get a "minimal" view—one that lumps together states that are unnecessarily discriminated—so we do not overtax our observational powers; 3. get an "independent" view—one that decomposes observed states into noninteracting qualities—so as to reduce the mental effort required.

      the Axiom of Experience: The future will be like the past, because, in the past, the future was like the past.

      But the Axiom of Experience can, like all of our principles, be turned around, to become a definition of what we mean by the word "like": Two things are alike if one in the present can be substituted for one in the past.

      In science as in poetry, the essential quality is not the finished metaphor itself, but the process of transformation, this is, the process of making the metaphor. And as the fabric of poetry or science is made, metaphors may be built upon metaphors, functions upon functions.

      One of the most deeply buried metaphors of science is the concept of a "thing" or "part" that can be separated cleanly from other things or parts. The metaphor is so deep we seldom know when we are using it.

      There are two kinds of people in the world—those who divide everything in the world into two kinds of things and those who don't. - Kenneth Boulding

      In sum, a quality is a way of grouping the states of a system. For example, the quality of mass is ultimately defined by displaying states of a system in which masses are the same or different.

      Scientists sometimes speak of two kinds of qualities—extensive and intensive—according to what happens to the quality when the system is divided into parts. If we break a chocolate bar in two pieces, each piece has a different mass than the original: thus mass would be called an extensive quality, since it depends on maintaining the full extent of the system. On the other hand, when we break the chocolate bar in half, each piece retains the same "chocolateness"; which is therefore said to be an intensive quality. Or, to take a more physical example, each half has the same density, so density is said to be an intensive quality.

      With respect to any given property, there are those transformations that preserve it and those that do not preserve it.

      We. understand change only by observing what remains invariant, and permanence only by what is transformed.

      Now we have always recognized that the operation of isolation is one which is almost indispensable in the common sense handling of the world around us, but at the same time it is an operation which is never sharply performable, for everything has a fringe of involvement with its surroundings. - P. W. Bridgman9

      This desire for consistency leads to the first mathematical condition for describing a partition, and thus, in our terms, describing a quality: For every state, x, the pair (x, x) must be in the relation. The mathematicians call this the reflexive condition. (Think of a reflection in a mirror.) When

      Symmetry The second property a relation must have to fit our intuitive notions of a quality is symmetry. The judgment as to whether two states are the same or different with respect to the quality in question should not depend, for example, on the order of appearance.

      Even if "friendship" is a symmetrical relationship in a particular system, we might still be unable to partition the system into subsystems of "friends" because of the necessity for transitivity, our third condition. Transitivity holds, for example, if we can say that B is a friend of A, and C is a friend of B, then C must be a friend of A. Clearly, in the case of friendship, transitivity need not hold at all, since A and C could just as well be either strangers or enemies.

      Along the Appalachian ridge each neighboring group of frogs can be successfully mated, but the frogs taken from the two ends of the chain cannot mate at all. Thus, to speak of dividing these frogs into species according to the mating criterion is to speak in fallacies. In fact, many naturalists have come to doubt the usefulness of any global species concept.

      As we shall see presently, the world often divides more clearly into parts than we would suspect from random divisions—divisions that have not been subjected to the tests of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

      The Perfect Systems Law: True systems properties cannot be investigated. In other words, the

      Strong Connection Law: Systems, on the average, are more tightly connected than the average.

      The Strong Connection Law can be stated in several interesting ways. We can say, for example, that A system is a collection of parts, no one of which can be changed.

      Strong Connection Law: In systems, all other things are rarely equal.

      Picture Principle: When speaking about a dimensional reduction, insert the words "a picture of" in whatever you were about to say.

      For example, we may discover that temperature is important in describing the behavior of a system. This discovery may come only after we have done numerous experiments that happened to be at a constant temperature, so we did not at first detect its importance. The descriptions of the system derived from these experiments now become descriptions of a particular projection of the system, a projection that eliminates temperature by holding it constant.

      If a line of behavior crosses itself, then either: the system is not state determined or we are viewing a projection—an incomplete view.

      Synchronic Principle: If two systems occupy the same position in the state space at the same time, then the space is under-dimensioned, that is, the view is incomplete.

      Thus, we offer the Count-to-Three Principle: If you cannot think of three ways of abusing a tool, you do not understand how to use it.

      Science may be thought of as the process of learning which ways of looking at things yield invariant laws.

      The laws of science may thus be descriptions of how the world looks ("Eureka"—I have found), or prescriptions for how to look at the world ("heuristic"—how to find). We really have no way of knowing which.

      the Principle of Indeterminability: We cannot with certainty attribute observed constraint either to system or environment.

      The number of untested assumptions in science is staggering. On any day we can open any one of dozens of newly arrived journals and find reports of "discoveries" that were made simply by relaxing a constraint that was in the observation process itself.

      Natives on the Pacific island of Nauru traditionally drank a strong home-brew made from fermented palm leaves. But after World War One, Nauru was mandated to Australia and prohibition was imposed. Infant mortality rose to the 50 percent level within six months. The reason? The people's natural diet was so low in vitamin B, that infants being nursed got the required amount of it only when the mother was drunk. When the natives were allowed to drink again, infant mortality fell at once to seven percent.

      These, then, are the three great questions that govern general systems thinking, the Systems Triumvirate: 1. Why do I see what I see? 2. Why do things stay the same ? 3. Why do things change?

      The general idea is always an abstraction and, for that very reason, is some sort of negation of real life... . Human thought, and, in consequence of this, science, can grasp and name only the general significance of real facts, their relations, their laws—in short, that which is permanent in their continual transformations—but never their material, individual side, palpitating, so to speak, with reality and life, and therefore fugitive and intangible. Science comprehends the thought of the reality, not reality itself; the thought of life, not life. That is its limit, its only really insuperable limit, because it is founded on the very nature of thought, which is the only organ of science. - Bakunin2

      In the final analysis, all three parts of the concept of stability—system, environment, and critical limits—depend on the observer. But then how do we account for the feeling that we have that stability is somehow central to our thinking about systems? The answer was nicely put by Parsons and Shils7 when they said: ... if a system is to be permanent enough to be worthy of study, there must be a tendency to maintenance of order except under unusual circumstances.

      Darwin9 recognized this situation over a century ago when he observed that: Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank that character as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed) which does not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance of an important part varying will ever be found; but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.

      Survival If you look at automata which have been built by men or which exist in nature you will very frequently notice that their structure is controlled to a much larger extent by the manner in which they might fail and by the (more or less effective) precautionary measures which have been taken against their failure. And to say that they are precautions against failure is to overstate the case, to use an optimistic terminology which is completely alien to the subject. Rather than precautions against failure, they are arrangements by which it is attempted to achieve a state where at least a majority of all failures will not be lethal. There can be no question of eliminating failures or of completely paralyzing the effects of failures. All we can try to do is to arrange an automaton so that in the vast majority of failures it can continue to operate. These arrangements give palliatives of failures, not cures. Most of the arrangements of artificial and natural automata and the principles involved therein are of this sort. - John von Neumann11

      The most fundamental concept in cybernetics is that of "difference," either that two things are recognizably different or that one thing has changed with time. - W. Ross Ashby12

      Law of Effect usually holds16: Small changes in structure usually lead to small changes in behavior. or, put in our terms: Small changes in the white box usually lead to small changes in the black box.

      Law of Effect can be stated in reverse: Small changes in behavior will usually be found to result from small changes in Structure.

      In general terms, rather than in terms of used cars, the law states that: A system that is doing a good job of regulation need not adapt. A system may adapt in order to simplify its job of regulating.

      Used Car Law to put specific emphasis on the observer's role: 1. A way of looking at the world not putting excessive stress on an observer need not be changed. 2. A way of looking at the world may be changed to reduce the stress on an observer.

      Neurology and Education In recent years, there has been increasing controversy over the practice of giving certain drugs particularly amphetamines—to schoolchildren, diagnosed as having a "disorder" known as "minimal brain dysfunction—MBD." The diagnosis of this syndrome is done strictly by behavior. Earlier, the syndrome was attributed to "brain damage," but nobody succeeded in discovering any structural "damage" to the brain. The problem in diagnosis comes from the broad range of symptoms, all of which are "normal" in some circumstances, which may be used as symptoms of this syndrome. Such symptoms are poor academic achievement, impulsive acts, short attention span, sudden emotional changes, lack of coordination, hyperactivity, and ease of distraction. It can be seen from this list how easy it would be to assign the label "MBD" to any student who does not conform to the teacher's idea of what a good student should be like. Discuss the problems of such a behavioral identification of "disease," particularly in the case of MBD. Reference: Paul H. Wendler, Minimal Brain Dysfunction in Children. New York: Wiley, 1971.
