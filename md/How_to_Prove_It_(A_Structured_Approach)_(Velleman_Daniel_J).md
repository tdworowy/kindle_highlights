#### How to Prove It (A Structured Approach) (Velleman, Daniel J.)
      The existence of even one counterexample establishes that the conjecture is incorrect, but

      Prime numbers of the form 2n − 1 are called Mersenne primes, after Father Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), a French monk and scholar who studied these numbers. Although many Mersenne primes have been found, it is still not known if there are infinitely many of them. Many of the largest known prime numbers are Mersenne primes. As of this writing (February 2019), the largest known prime number is the Mersenne prime 282,589,933 − 1, a number with 24,862,048 digits.

      positive integer n is said to be perfect if n is equal to the sum of all positive integers smaller than n that divide n. (For any two integers m and n, we say that m divides n if n is divisible by m; in other words, if there is an integer q such that n = qm.)
