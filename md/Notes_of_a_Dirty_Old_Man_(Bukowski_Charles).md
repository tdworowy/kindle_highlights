#### Notes of a Dirty Old Man (Bukowski, Charles)
      A doctor comes to my door: “I read your column and I think that I can help you. I used to be a psychiatrist.” I send him away.

      “listen, friend,” he said, “this whole game is just one big deck of cards. if you want to get into the game you have to take whatever comes up in the shuffle.”

      I laugh. he’s comfortable and he’s human. every man is afraid of being a queer. I get a little tired of it. maybe we should all become queers and relax. not belting Jack. he’s good for a change. there are too many people afraid to speak against queers — intellectually. just as there are too many people afraid to speak against the left wing — intellectually. I don’t care which way it goes — I only know: there are too many people afraid.

      “the whole poetry game is run by the fags and the left-wing,” he tells me, staring into the canal.

      “this guy’s o.k. he killed himself, his father, his mother, wife, but didn’t shoot his three children or the dog. one of the best poets since Baudelaire.”

      knowledge without follow-through is worse than no knowledge at all.

      the reason the average person is at the track is that they are driven screwy by the turn of the bolt, the foreman’s insane face, the landlord’s hand, the lover’s dead sex; taxation, cancer, the blues; clothes that fall apart on a 3rd wearing, water that tastes like piss, doctors that run assembly-line and indecent offices, hospitals without heart, politicians with skulls filled with pus …

      what they won’t tell us is that our madmen, our assassins do spring from our present mode of life, our good old All-American way of living and dying. Christ, that we are all not outwardly raving, that’s the miracle! and since we have been rather sombre here, let’s end it on the light fantastic, speaking, as we are, about madness.

      second Kennedy had not yet been assassinated. but I got the odd feeling, sitting in that room with him that things were not well, not well at all, and would not be, would not be for another couple of thousand years at least.

      “that’s why we’re friends, I guess. that’s what friendship means: sharing the prejudice of experience.”

      “society’s laws and nature’s laws are different. we have an unnatural society. that’s why we are near to being blown to Hell. intuitively the female knows that the fake survives in our society and that is why she prefers him. she is only interested in bearing the child and bringing him through safely.”

      men are taken into rooms for questioning and come out half-men or no-men at all. some men hope for revolution but when you revolt and set up your new government you find your new government is still the same old Papa,

      when you are given a choice between Nixon and Humphrey it’s like being given a choice between eating warm shit or cold shit.

      you just can’t give a man a new government like a new hat and expect a different man inside that hat.

      the ideology was only to keep the guns going.

      revolution sounds very romantic, you know. but it ain’t. it’s blood and guts and madness; it’s little kids killed who get in the way, it’s little kids who don’t understand what the fuck is going

      I am ashamed to be a member of the human race but I don’t want to add any more to that shame, I want to scrape a little of it off.

      it’s one thing to talk about Revolution while your belly is full of another man’s beer and you’re traveling with a sixteen-year-old runaway girl from Grand Rapids; it’s one thing to talk about Revolution while three jackass writers of international fame have you dancing to the OOOOOOOOOOMMM game; it’s another thing to bring it about, it’s another thing to have happen.

      and pot. they always equate pot with Revolution. pot just isn’t that good. for Christ’s sake, if they legalized pot half the people would stop smoking it.

      the rats are the true revolutionaries; the rats are the true underground, but they don’t want your ass except to nibble on and they are not interested in OOOOOOOOOMMM.

      to say that he lived well is true; to say that I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true.

      the ladies usually go for the biggest damn fool they can find; that is why the human race stands where it does today: we have bred the clever and lasting Casanovas, all hollow inside, like the chocolate Easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children.

      first of all, read Celine. the greatest writer of 2,000 years. of course, THE STRANGER by Camus must fit in. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. THE BROTHERS. all of Kafka. all the works of the unknown writer John Fante. the short stories of Turgenev.

      everywhere we hang onto the walls of the world, and in the darkest part of hangover, I think of two friends who advise me on various methods of suicide. what better proof of loving camaraderie? one of my friends has razor scars running all along his left arm. the other jams pills by the bucketloads into a mass of black beard. they both write poetry. there is something about writing poetry that brings a man close to the cliff’s edge.

      and the worst worry/fear/agony tiredness of them all is the one you can’t explain or understand or even think out.

      “Frank’s probably a good guy, tho,” I said, “don’t knock Frank too much, you know what I mean?” this is the old pro’s line. always pretend to be understanding, even when you are not. women never want sensibility, all they want is a kind of emotional vindictiveness toward somebody else they care for too much.

      women are basically stupid animals but they concentrate so much and entirely upon the male that they often defeat him while he is thinking of other things.
