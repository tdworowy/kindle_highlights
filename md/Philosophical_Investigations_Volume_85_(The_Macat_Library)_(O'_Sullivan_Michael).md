#### Philosophical Investigations: Volume 85 (The Macat Library) (O' Sullivan, Michael)
      In epistemology, contextualism is the view that what counts as knowledge in one context may not count as knowledge in another. I may believe I know, for everyday purposes, that a colleague is trustworthy. But if I am a witness in a court of law, where higher standards of evidence are demanded, I may not count on knowing this. Wittgenstein put forward something like this view in his late work On Certainty, but it also has roots in Investigations.
