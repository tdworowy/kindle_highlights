#### Fight Club: A Novel (Palahniuk, Chuck)
      The three ways to make napalm: One, you can mix equal parts of gasoline and frozen orange juice concentrate. Two, you can mix equal parts of gasoline and diet cola. Three, you can dissolve crumbled cat litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.

      We have sort of a triangle thing going here. I want Tyler. Tyler wants Marla. Marla wants me. I don’t want Marla, and Tyler doesn’t want me around, not anymore. This isn’t about love as in caring. This is about property as in ownership.

      I had to know what Tyler was doing while I was asleep. If I could wake up in a different place, at a different time, could I wake up as a different person?

      One minute was enough, Tyler said, a person had to work hard for it, but a minute of perfection was worth the effort. A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.

      Then you’re trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.

      The phone rang in Tyler’s rented house on Paper Street.

      "If you don’t know what you want,” the doorman said, "you end up with a lot you don’t.”

      May I never be complete. May I never be content. May I never be perfect. Deliver me, Tyler, from being perfect and complete.

      Sometimes, Tyler speaks for me.

      At the time, my life just seemed too complete, and maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves.

      I’m starting to wonder if Tyler and Marla are the same person. Except for their humping, every night in

      Tyler and Marla are never in the same room. I never see them together.

      I turn around, and Tyler’s appeared. Tyler says, "Did you get rid of her?” Not a sound, not a smell, Tyler’s just appeared

      "It’s only after you’ve lost everything,” Tyler says, "that you’re free to do anything.”

      "Where you’re at, now,” Tyler says, "you can’t even imagine what the bottom will be like.”

      The second Marla opens the screen door, Tyler is gone, vanished, run out of the room, disappeared.

      The moment Marla is out the door, Tyler appears back in the room. Fast as a magic trick. My parents did this magic act for five years.

      "Don’t ever talk to her about me. Don’t talk about me behind my back. Do you promise?” Tyler says. I promise.

      shining wet kiss on the back of my hand. "This is a chemical burn,” Tyler says, "and it will hurt worse than you’ve ever been burned. Worse than a hundred cigarettes.”

      That was Tyler’s first mission as a service industry terrorist. Guerrilla waiter. Minimum-wage despoiler. Tyler’s been doing this for years, but he says everything is more fun as a shared activity.

      What you have to know is that Marla is still alive. Marla’s philosophy of life, she told me, is that she can die at any moment. The tragedy of her life is that she doesn’t.

      Marla’s heart looked the way my face was. The crap and the trash of the world. Post-consumer human butt wipe that no one would ever go to the trouble to recycle.

      "When you’re twenty-four,” Marla says, "you have no idea how far you can really fall, but I was a fast learner.”

      "Disaster is a natural part of my evolution,” Tyler whispered, "toward tragedy and dissolution.”

      "I’m breaking my attachment to physical power and possessions,” Tyler whispered, "because only through destroying myself can I discover the greater power of my spirit.”

      "The liberator who destroys my property,” Tyler said, "is fighting to save my spirit. The teacher who clears all possessions from my path will set me free.”

      Arson meets on Monday. Assault on Tuesday. Mischief meets on Wednesday. And Misinformation meets on Thursday. Organized Chaos. The Bureaucracy of Anarchy. You figure it out. Support groups. Sort

      The goal was to teach each man in the project that he had the power to control history. We, each of us, can take control of the world.

      I wanted to burn the Louvre. I’d do the Elgin Marbles with a sledgehammer and wipe my ass with the Mona Lisa. This is my world, now.

      If you know where to look, there are bodies buried everywhere.

      "You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everyone else, and we are all part of the same compost pile.”

      telephone was ringing in my dream, and it’s not clear if reality slipped into my dream or if my dream is slopping over into reality.

      Here, I’m not sure if Tyler is my dream.

      "What you have to consider,” he says, "is the possibility that God doesn’t like you. Could be, God hates us. This is not the worst thing that can happen.”

      "Burn the Louvre,” the mechanic says, "and wipe your ass with the Mona Lisa. This way at least, God would know our names.”

      "Drunk Drivers Against Mothers.” "Recycle All the Animals.”

      "I Drive Better When I’m Drunk.”

      "You had a near-life experience,” the mechanic says.

      Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don’t really need.

      You didn’t say anything. Get out of here, and do your little life, but remember I’m watching you, Raymond Hessel, and I’d rather kill you than see you working a shit job for just enough money to buy cheese and watch television.

      This is what Tyler wants me to do. These are Tyler’s words coming out of my mouth. I am Tyler’s mouth. I am Tyler’s hands.

      Set your watch ahead an hour. If you can wake up in a different place. If you can wake up in a different time. Why can’t you wake up as a different person?

      Yeah, I say, it’s a test. Has he ever met Tyler Durden? "You stopped in last week, Mr. Durden,” he says. "Don’t you remember?” Tyler was here. "You were here, sir.” I’ve never been in here before tonight.

      "Every time you fall asleep,” Tyler says, "I run off and do something wild, something crazy, something completely out of my mind.”

      "There isn’t a me and a you, anymore,” Tyler says, and he pinches the end of my nose. "I think you’ve figured that out.”

      "We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we’ll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won’t. And we’re just learning this fact,” Tyler said. "So don’t fuck with us.”

      "And the jobs, well, why do you think you’re so tired. Geez, it’s not insomnia. As soon as you fall asleep, I take over and go to work or fight club or whatever. You’re lucky I didn’t get a job as a snake handler.”

      "Just like Tony Perkins’ mother in Psycho,” Marla says. "This is so cool. Everybody has their little quirks. One time, I dated a guy who couldn’t get enough body piercings.”

      THAT OLD SAYING, about how you always kill the thing you love, well, it works both ways. And it does work both ways.

      How everything you ever love will reject you or die. Everything you ever create will be thrown away. Everything you’re proud of will end up as trash. I am Ozymandias, king of kings.
