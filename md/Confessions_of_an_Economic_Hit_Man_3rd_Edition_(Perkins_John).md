#### Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, 3rd Edition (Perkins, John)
      Economic hit men (EHMs) are highly paid professionals who cheat countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. They funnel money from the World Bank, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and other foreign “aid” organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet’s natural resources. Their tools include fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, sex, and murder. They play a game as old as empire, but one that has taken on new and terrifying dimensions during this time of globalization. I should know; I was an EHM.*

      First, competition for global dominance had shifted from the military to the economic. Second, there was a trend toward uniting the world under initiatives like China’s New Silk Road (officially the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI) and American-led global financial structures. And third, the future of life as we know it depends on ending EHM strategies everywhere and transforming a failing degenerative system, known as a death economy, into a regenerative one, known as a life economy.

      The failure of the world’s largest, best-equipped military to defeat North Vietnam, combined with the Cold War specter of a nuclear holocaust, replaced the pillar of instilling fear in others with the pillar of debt as the primary tactic.

      Nearly every top Ecuadorean official involved in the dam’s construction is either imprisoned or sentenced on bribery charges. . . . Then there is the price tag: around $19 billion in Chinese loans, not only for this dam, known as Coca Codo Sinclair but also for bridges, highways, irrigation, schools, health clinics and a half dozen other dams the government is scrambling to pay for. It doesn’t matter whether Ecuador can afford them. China gets paid either way. To settle the bill, China gets to keep 80 percent of Ecuador’s most valuable export—oil. . . . “China took advantage of Ecuador,” said Ecuador’s energy minister, Carlos Pérez. “The strategy of China is clear. They take economic control of countries.”4

      “Texaco pays for all that?” Ann asked. “Well, not exactly . . .” He reached across the table and patted her arm. “You do. Or your daddy does. The American taxpayer. The money flows through USAID, the World Bank, CIA, and the Pentagon, but everyone here”—he swept his arm toward the window and the city below—“knows it’s all about Texaco. Remember, countries like this have long histories of coups. If you take a good look, you’ll see that most of them happen when the leaders of the country don’t play our game.”1 “Are you saying Texaco overthrows governments?” I asked.

      He laughed. “Let’s just say that governments that don’t cooperate are seen as Soviet puppets. They threaten American interests and democracy. The CIA doesn’t like that.”

      My realization about enabling that community was a great lesson for me. I understood that the victims themselves could be unwitting collaborators and that taking action offered the only solution. And it worked.

      If an EHM is completely successful, the loans are so large that the debtor is forced to default on its payments after a few years. When this happens, we demand our pound of flesh. This often includes one or more of the following: control over United Nations votes, the installation of military bases, or access to precious resources such as oil. Of course, the debtor still owes us the money—and another country is added to our global empire.

      Several days later the popular Bandung politician, whose puppet stood up to Nixon and was impaled by Bucket Man, was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver.

      “Do you know who owns United Fruit?” he asked. “Zapata Oil, George Bush’s company—our UN ambassador.” I said. “A man with ambitions.” He leaned forward and lowered his voice. “And now I’m up against his cronies at Bechtel.”

      The Depression resulted in the New Deal and in policies that promoted economic regulation, governmental financial manipulation, and the extensive application of fiscal policy.

      The 1960s was a pivotal decade in this period and in the shift from neoclassic to Keynesian economics. It happened under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and perhaps the most important single influence was one man, Robert McNamara.

      see now that Robert McNamara’s greatest and most sinister contributions to history were to jockey the World Bank into becoming an agent of global empire on a scale never before witnessed and to set a dangerous precedent. He advocated the idea that “If you want your country to prosper, accept loans from the World Bank, hire our companies to build infrastructure projects, and adhere to the conditions imposed by it and the IMF” and took it to new levels. His ability to bridge the gaps between the primary components of the corporatocracy would be fine-tuned by his successors.

      This happened during my time as an EHM and continues today. For instance, George Shultz was secretary of the treasury under Nixon, served as Bechtel president, and then became secretary of state under Reagan. Caspar Weinberger was a Bechtel vice president and general counsel, and later secretary of defense under

      Reagan. Richard Cheney served as secretary of defense under George H. W. Bush (himself a former oil man, US ambassador to the UN, and CIA director), as Halliburton president, and as US vice president to George W. Bush. Bill Clinton’s treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, had been co-chairman at Goldman Sachs. The list is overwhelming, continuing under Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden.

      In the eighteenth century, Mohammed ibn Saud, a local warlord, joined forces with fundamentalists from the ultraconservative Wahhabi sect. It was a powerful union, and during the next two hundred years the Saud family and their Wahhabi allies conquered most of the Arabian Peninsula, including Islam’s holiest sites, Mecca and Medina.

      United States–Saudi Arabian Joint Economic Commission. Known as JECOR, it embodied an innovative concept that was the opposite of traditional foreign aid programs: it relied on Saudi money to hire American firms to build up Saudi Arabia.

      The condition was that Saudi Arabia would use its petrodollars to purchase US government securities; in turn, the interest earned by these securities would be spent by the US Department of the Treasury in ways that enabled Saudi Arabia to emerge from an outmoded society into the modern, industrialized world. In other words, the interest compounding on billions of dollars of the kingdom’s oil income would be used to pay US companies to fulfill the vision I (and presumably some of my competitors) had come up with, to convert Saudi Arabia into a modern industrial power. Our own Department of the Treasury would hire us, at Saudi expense, to build infrastructure projects and even entire cities throughout the Arabian Peninsula.

      The evidence was indisputable: Saudi Arabia, America’s longtime ally and the world’s largest oil producer, had somehow become, as a senior Treasury Department official put it, “the epicenter” of terrorist financing. . . . Starting in the late 1980s—after the dual shocks of the Iranian revolution and the Soviet war in Afghanistan—Saudi Arabia’s quasi-official charities became the primary source of funds for the fast-growing jihad movement. In some 20 countries the money was used to run paramilitary training camps, purchase weapons, and recruit new members. . . .

      Saudi largess encouraged U.S. officials to look the other way, some veteran intelligence officers say. Billions of dollars in contracts, grants, and salaries have gone to a broad range of former U.S. officials who had dealt with the Saudis: ambassadors, CIA station chiefs, even cabinet secretaries. . . . Electronic intercepts of conversations implicated members of the royal family in backing not only Al Qaeda but also other terrorist groups.

      I brought a young MIT mathematician, Dr. Nadipuram Prasad, into my department and gave him a budget. Within six months he developed the Markov method for econometric modeling. Together we hammered out a series of technical papers that presented Markov as a revolutionary method for forecasting the impact of infrastructure investment on economic development. It was exactly what we wanted: a tool that scientifically “proved” we were doing countries a favor by helping them incur debts they would never be able to pay off. In addition, only a highly skilled econometrician with lots of time and money could possibly comprehend the intricacies of Markov or question its conclusions. The papers were published by several prestigious organizations, and we formally presented them at conferences and universities in a number of countries. The papers—and we—became famous throughout the industry.2

      “We—my people—are part of the desert. The people the shah claims to rule with that iron hand of his are not just of the desert. We are the desert.”

      “Quite simple. He is your only real ally in the Middle East, and the industrial world rotates on the axle of oil that is the Middle East. Oh, you have Israel, of course, but that’s actually a liability to you, not an asset. And no oil there. Your politicians must placate the Jewish vote, must get their money to finance campaigns. So, you’re stuck with Israel, I’m afraid. However, Iran is the key. Your oil companies need us. You need our shah—or you think you do, just as you thought you needed South Vietnam’s corrupt leaders.” “Is Iran the equivalent of Vietnam?”

      I had no answer. The relief turned into defensiveness. I stammered out the standard justifications: that I was trying to do good, that I was exploring ways to change the system from within, and—the old standby—that if I quit, someone even worse would fill my shoes. But I could see from the way she watched me that she was not buying it. Even worse, I knew that I was not buying it either. She had forced me to understand the essential truth: it was not my job, but me, that was to blame.

      According to some sources, SIL received funding from the Rockefeller charities. Family scion John D. Rockefeller had founded Standard Oil—which later divested into the majors, including Chevron, Exxon, and Mobil.

      “Once Bush took his seat on the board, wonderful things started to happen to Harken—new investments, unexpected sources of financing, serendipitous drilling rights.”

      Perhaps, therefore, it should not have stunned the world when, on December 20, 1989, the United States attacked Panama with what was reported to be the largest airborne assault on a city since World War II.6 It was an unprovoked attack on a civilian population. Panama and its people posed absolutely no threat to the United States or to any other country.

      Iraq is not simply about oil. It is also about water and geopolitics. Both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers flow through Iraq; thus, among all the countries in that part of the world, Iraq controls much of the increasingly critical water resources.

      Military strategists equate modern Iraq to the Hudson River valley during the French and Indian War and the American Revolution. In the eighteenth century, the French, British, and Americans knew that whoever controlled the Hudson River valley controlled the continent. Today, it is common knowledge that whoever controls Iraq holds a trump card in the Middle East.

      Bush responded with a denunciation of Saddam for violating international law, even though it had been less than a year since Bush himself had staged the illegal and unilateral invasion of Panama.

      I thought about the core tools we EHMs used in my day: false economics that included distorted financial analyses, inflated projections and rigged accounting books, secrecy, deception, threats, bribes, extortion; false promises that were never intended to be honored; and enslavement through debt and fears.

      While sixty of the poorest countries had paid $550 billion over three decades in both principal and interest on loans of $540 billion, they still owed a whopping $523 billion on those same loans. The cost of servicing that debt was more than these countries spent on health or education and twenty times the amount they received annually in foreign aid.

      Daschle and Dodd were Democrats. Among Republicans who had jumped from the Senate into the lobbyist club were John Ashcroft, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, Chuck Hagel, Trent Lott, Warren Rudman—the list of both Democrats and Republicans seemed endless. And there were still more who had transformed themselves into EHMs from the US House of Representatives.

      In Argentina, the authorities’ battles with a small number of “investors” (so-called vulture funds) jeopardised an entire debt restructuring agreed to—voluntarily—by an overwhelming majority of the country’s creditors. In Greece . . . the country is forced into austerity policies that have contributed mightily to a 25% decline in GDP and have left its population worse off. In Ukraine, the potential political ramifications of sovereign-debt distress are enormous.18

      “At least 6,000 peoples’ [sic] lives have been unjustly taken by United States drone attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, the Philippines, Libya and Syria,” states a June 2015 letter released by dozens of US military veterans. In that letter they urge drone operators to “refuse to fly missions” or support such activities in any way. These veterans understand that indiscriminate drone strikes on civilians are seen by most of the world as acts of terror.”2

      By 2012 there were almost 110,000 contracted mercenary forces in Afghanistan alone, compared to 68,000 US military personnel. To place this in perspective: in Vietnam there were 70,000 mercenaries and 359,000 military personnel.10

      Approximately 14 million tons of ordnance were dropped on Vietnam by US forces (1959–75), three times the bombs used by the Allies in World War II. • About 30 percent failed to detonate; unexploded US ordnance (UXO) still threatens civilians. • Buried bombs and mines claimed more than one hundred thousand victims since the end of the war. • Near the former Demilitarized Zone between North and South Vietnam, 80 percent of the land today is contaminated by UXO.2 • More than 3 million Vietnamese suffer from the effects of Agent Orange.3

      Chinese FDI stocks in Africa grew nearly 100-fold over a 17-year period—from $490 million in 2003 to $43.4 billion in 2020, peaking in 2018 at $46.1 billion . . . ahead of the United States since 2014.3

      China’s “If you want your country to prosper, accept China as a partner in global trade that will not interfere in your government” sounds a lot better than the US’s “If you want your country to prosper, accept loans from the Washington Consensus . . . and submit to neoliberal policies.” China’s EHMs understand that trade works far more effectively than coercion in today’s world. By 2021, China had become the dominant force in Africa: the biggest bilateral trading partner, largest bilateral lender, and one of the most influential foreign investors.

      Many analysts have referred to China’s extension of credit lines for infrastructure development in Africa as “debt-trap diplomacy.” According to some estimates, Angola owes more than US$20 billion to three Chinese entities—China Development Bank, China EXIM Bank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).

      By 1997, Mao was dead, Zaire was in dire economic straits, and Mobutu was overthrown by Laurent-Désiré Kabila. All-out war spread through nine African countries. Known as “the worst war in the world since World War II,” it lasted until 2003 and caused the deaths of more than 5 million people.

      When the Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, the former Ottoman Empire was divided into many countries without regard for culture, ethnicity, religious beliefs, or history. It was done intentionally to create conflict, turmoil, and corruption, thus giving the British and French control over the area.1

      China has been the biggest winner in the post-U.S. Middle East. Beijing was already the largest buyer of the region’s oil. Now [2021], without fanfare, it has become the only outside power that has strong political and trading ties with every major country there.

      Even America’s long-term ally, Israel, turned to the East. China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation participated in the building of Israeli tunnels and Tel Aviv’s light rail. Chinese companies now manage three of Israel’s ports. In 2020, China replaced the US as Israel’s number one provider of imports.

      US EHMs have not relied extensively on debt or insufficiency in most of Europe. Rather, they focus on fear: first, of the Soviet Union, then Russia and now also Muslim terrorists. Their divide-and-conquer pillar is driven by Moscow’s attempts to reestablish itself in Crimea, Ukraine, and other former Soviet countries.

      One of the world’s most expensive roads slices through the mountains of Montenegro, soaring over deep gorges on towering bridges, before reaching its destination: a muddy field outside a hamlet with a few dozen houses, many of them empty . . . , Matesevo (population: around 15). . . . Montenegro’s new prime minister, Zdravko Krivokapic, who took over late last year from the government that signed the road and loan contracts with China in 2014, described the highway as a “megalomaniac project” that “goes from nowhere to nowhere” and badly strained his country’s finances.6

      More than a third of all international students attending US colleges and universities in the 2019–2020 academic year were from China.

      Former lawmakers Ed Royce, David Vitter and Trent Lott were all known for standing up to China during their time in Congress. Today they share a different affinity: All three lobby for Chinese companies that have been accused of posing a national security threat to the United States. . . . They are among 12 former members of Congress currently registered as foreign agents for Chinese companies or lobbyists for their US affiliates. . . .4

      Our folly is our xenophobic obsession that someone else is the enemy. It is time to replace these with fear of a real and impending enemy: a system that is propelling us ever closer to self-destruction.
