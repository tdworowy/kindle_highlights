#### Why Most Things Fail (Ormerod, Paul)
      An argument I first made ten years ago in my book The Death of Economics noted that conventional economics views the economy and society as machines, whose behaviour, no matter how complicated, is ultimately predictable and controllable. On the contrary, however, human society is more like a living organism. My previous book, Butterfly Economics,

      The third theme, developed in particular towards the end of the book, is that failure can be highly beneficial. In the real world in which strategies evolve and which is itself the outcome of a dynamic process of change, failure at the level of the individual component part can, paradoxically, enhance the fitness of the system as a whole.

      laconically, ‘The tendency to overemphasize successes, and to rationalize them ex post is chronically endemic amongst business historians and management consultants.’

      Books proliferate, and occasionally sell in very large numbers, which claim to have found the rule, or small set of rules, which will guarantee business success. But business is far too complicated, far too difficult an activity to distil into a few simple commands, be it the ‘set price equal to marginal cost’ of economic theory, or some of the more exotic exhortations of the business gurus. It is failure rather than success which is the distinguishing feature of corporate life.

      We will see that economic theory neglects almost completely the widespread existence of corporate failure.

      P. J. O’Rourke, in his entertaining book Eat the Rich, has a stimulating definition of the content of the subject: ‘One thing that economists do know is that the study of economics is divided into two fields, “microeconomics” and “macroeconomics”. Micro is the study of individual behaviour, and macro is the study of how economies behave as a whole. That is, microeconomics concerns things that economists are specifically wrong about, while macroeconomics concerns things economists are wrong about generally.’

      over 10 per cent of all companies in the US, the largest and most successful economy in the history of the world, fail every single year.

      particular within economics, there is a difference to be drawn. Risk refers to situations in which the outcome cannot be known with certainty, but the probability of any given outcome is understood perfectly.

      Uncertainty, in its strict sense, refers to situations in which the probability of the various outcomes is itself unknown.

      And despite enormous increases in the number of air travellers in the second half of the twentieth century, the combined profit made by airlines over the period 1955–2000 was less than the losses they incurred in just the two years 2001 and 2002.

      of the century, the scope of the state increased markedly. In every western country, the size of state activity in the economy was considerably greater in 2000 than it was in 1950. In Britain, for example, in the middle of the twentieth century the most openly socialist administration in the history of the country was in power, but government spending as a percentage of the economy was lower then than it was under Mrs Thatcher in the 1980s.

      By the turn of the century, almost 20 per cent of total national income in many countries in the European Union was diverted to subsidies for the poor, tax-break payments to households and other social benefits. Even in the United States, the comparable figure was over 10 per cent. In total, government spending accounted for as much as 48 per cent of national income in the EU and 36 per cent in the US.

      Yet despite the efforts of western governments for at least half a century, not only do social problems persist, but from time to time they appear to intensify. Society becomes less and not more equal. Social policies aimed at reducing inequality appear to fail.

      The New York Times in January 2003 reported on a study of social mobility in America. Sociologists Robert Perrucci and Earl Wysong analyzed the incomes and occupations of 2,749 fathers and sons between 1970 and the late 1990s. They concluded that social mobility had fallen sharply. As they became adults, children became more likely over this period to retain the class privileges or disadvantages of their parents. Studies in Britain also show a marked fall in social mobility over a similar timescale, from around the late 1960s to the present day. These outcomes cannot be ascribed in a simplistic way to ‘Reaganism’ or ‘Thatcherism’, because the trends were already established well before these often demonized figures ever came to power and have continued long after they lost it.

      Collecting data to estimate the Gini over long periods of time is extremely difficult. Estimates in recent years, for example, depend a great deal on the information available in the records of the income-tax authorities. Most adults in the west now either pay tax on their income or receive income in the form of benefits from the state. Indeed, given the massive complications of most tax and benefit systems, many people both pay tax and receive benefits in one form or another. The point here is that reasonably reliable information now exists on the individual incomes of almost all adults. For most of history, and even for the history of the last two hundred years of industrial capitalism, this was not the case. State spending as a proportion of the overall economy was much lower, and so most people were not required to pay income tax.

      In other words, the distribution of income within countries is fluid and dynamic, sometimes appearing to be stable, then moving suddenly in one direction or the other. There is a tendency over a long period of time for income to be more equitably distributed, but around this trend there are irregular fluctuations of various sizes and lengths of time.

      areas of the world, for colonization was

      The current-day pessimists are completely wrong when they repeatedly assert that the world as a whole is becoming more unequal. For the first time in the history of capitalism, the distribution of world income between countries became more equal in the second half of the twentieth century, and in particular during its final quarter. The economic successes in Asia have liberated many, many millions of people from lives of unremitting drudgery and toil, and have reduced world income inequality. But, just as with the movements over time in inequality within nations, changes in global inequality have not happened smoothly.

      The dimensions of the problem that confronts policy-makers in trying to decide strategy, with many different factors affecting the outcome of any decision, are too large to be grasped in their entirety. In these circumstances, there is ample scope for decisions to go wrong. In short, there is ample scope for strategy to fail at any point in time.

      In order to control a system – any system, whether an economy, a biological system or a machine – we need to be able to do two things: first, make forecasts which are reasonably accurate in a systematic way over time; and second, understand with reasonable accuracy the effect of changes in policy on the system one is trying to control.

      Unless policy-makers know with reasonable confidence what state the system is likely to be in at some point in the future, it is not possible to say what action is required now in order to bring about a more desirable outcome. And unless the authorities understand the impact of their actions, it is not possible to know what should be done in order to bring about any desired outcome. The scope for failure abounds.

      The Economist magazine reported in February 2003 that American schools were more segmented on racial lines than they were in the 1960s. And it was precisely in the 1960s that major initiatives began to be taken to improve integration and break down the old racial barriers.

      The rules of the Schelling game appear to be – and indeed are – simple, but they give rise to complex, and unanticipated, behaviour of the system.

      Criticisms of the conventional economic account of how markets work must not, of course, be confused with criticism of markets as such. Markets clearly work in practice, and work in general to the benefit of humanity. But, a century after Marshall, to quote Nobel laureate Vernon Smith again, ‘We do not understand why markets work as they do.’

      A key paradox begins to emerge from all this. Humans, whether acting as individuals or making collective decisions in companies or governments, behave with purpose. They take decisions with the aim of achieving specific, desired outcomes. Yet our view of the world which is emerging is one in which it is either very difficult or even impossible to predict the consequences of decisions in any meaningful sense.

      Our understanding of the consequences of decisions we take today on our future well-being, on our fitness for survival, appears to be very limited. Companies want not merely to survive but to make profits and prosper. Yet, as we have seen, they often fail. Governments want to achieve all kinds of desirable social goals, yet they, too, often fail.

      So a CEO of a giant company at the height of his powers misjudged entirely the consequences of his attempted management buyout. He thought he would succeed. He failed. He thought the company could be bought for some $70 a share. It was eventually sold at over $100.

      Running a business is, as we have seen, much harder than playing chess. It is also much harder than analyzing the Hotelling location model, or playing the Hotelling location game, as we might think of it. Even making dramatic simplifications of reality, we cannot really draw any definite conclusions from this game unless we are in possession of immense detail concerning consumer preferences and, even more difficult, the intentions of our potential rivals. And if we cannot make firm recommendations or give clear-cut advice to players of this game, how can we possibly hope to do any better when advising firms who face this problem in real life?

      ‘There are four stages of acceptance: i) this is worthless nonsense; ii) this is an interesting, but perverse, point of view; iii) this is true, but quite unimportant; iv) I always said so.’

      Policies which try to contain percolation across such networks are very hard to implement. Unless each one of the very small number of highly connected individuals is

      targeted effectively and immunized, the virus will persist. Immunization at random of even a large proportion of the population will simply not succeed, unless purely by chance not just some but all of the highly connected are caught.

      In a purely economic context, firms can interact in ways which damage each other’s fitness for survival. They can, for example, become involved in a price war, the end result of which is simply to reduce each other’s profits. A less obvious example was the decision by the food superstores in Britain to open on Sundays some fifteen years ago. Legislation had made it possible for the first time, but the companies hesitated. Nevertheless, as soon as one began Sunday opening, the others were compelled to follow for fear of losing market share. However, the total sales passing through these stores did not increase as a result, for shoppers already had ample opportunity to visit the stores during the rest of the week. The consumers were happier, but all the companies themselves ended up incurring higher costs, through the extra wages paid on the Sunday, for example, with no increase in sales.

      In short, despite the ability of humans and human institutions to act with intent, in reality it is as if they operate close to the paradigm of the agent with zero cognitive ability. They do not have to mimic it completely, and a small amount of ability to translate intent into desired outcome is compatible with the evidence we observe, but no more than that.

      To repeat a key phrase which needs to be hard-wired into the brain of every decision-maker, whether in the public or private sector, intent is not the same as outcome.

      Hayek attacked conventional economic theory at an even deeper level. His achievement was to show that, theoretically, market-based economies are inherently superior to planned ones. Paradoxically, conventional free-market economic theory cannot demonstrate this result. Indeed, it is equally relevant to the idealized world of both the central planner and the pure free market.

      It was Hayek’s genius to offer a completely different, and much more realistic, view of how economies operate. In a Hayekian world, decentralized decision-making by individual agents is unequivocally superior to central planning. Indeed, a central plan may well be the worst possible institutional framework an economy could have.

      Hayek’s view is much more rooted in biology. Individual behaviour is not fixed, like a screw or cog in a machine is, but evolves in response to the behaviour of others. Control and prediction of the system as a whole is simply not possible.

      For Hayek, ‘an economist who is only an economist cannot be a good economist’.

      creating the risk that it will happen again. Much more generally, it is innovation,

      Much more generally, it is innovation, evolution and competition which are the hallmarks of a successful system. This is a fundamental message from Hayek and Schumpeter which shines to us across the decades.

      So a demanding and competitive external environment is essential for the health of the system as whole. But economic regulators, with the possible exception of the US authorities, are obsessed with something entirely different. Their mission in life is to promote competition within the system, to increase the level of competition between the individual agents inside the system.

      Hayek emphasized the importance of the process of the evolution of strategy, of discovering new and more effective ways of doing things. Both these views imply that strong market positions will be created temporarily for particularly successful innovators. They will be able to exercise market power and raise their profit margins. This is the reward to innovation at the individual level but, as we have seen, this also brings benefits to the system as a whole.

      In terms of the public policy implications, the authorities need to recognize that within a single industry co-operative relationships between firms are necessary for the fitness of the industry as whole. If competition is enforced too strongly, the overall fitness of the industry is reduced. But protection for the industry as a whole also tends to reduce overall fitness. Firms need an external environment which is competitive but require a certain level of co-operative behaviour between each other within the industry.

      The point is not to ridicule such policies, though each has its own particular streak of lunacy. Almost every reader will be able to come up with similar stories. The point is that the state, at both national and local level, now feels obliged to intervene, to have policies regarding almost every aspect of life. Whether walking, jogging or riding a bike, teams of inspectors are on hand to endeavour to ensure that targets are met on these various means of locomotion. Indeed, the current British government has announced no fewer than 8,000 numerical targets since coming to power in 1997.

      Administering public policy is a far more complicated task, and the dimensions of the problem are even greater than those described by our models and games. Not surprisingly, the cast of mind which believes in detailed planning and monitoring usually fails.
