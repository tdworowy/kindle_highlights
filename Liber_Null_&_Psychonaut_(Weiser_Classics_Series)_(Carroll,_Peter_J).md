#### Liber Null & Psychonaut (Weiser Classics Series) (Carroll, Peter J.)
      Two major themes run through this book: that altered states of consciousness are the key to unlocking one's magical abilities; and that these abilities can be developed without any symbolic system except reality itself.

      Magic is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will.

      Even a slight ability to change oneself is more valuable than any power over the external universe.

      To proceed, select any minor habit at random and delete it from your behavior; at the same time, adopt any new habit at random. The choices should not involve anything of spiritual, egocentric, or emotional significance, nor should you select anything with any possibility of failure. By persisting with such simple beginnings, you become capable of virtually anything.

      The “thing” responsible for the origin and continued action of events is called chaos by magicians. It could as well be called God or Tao, but the name “Chaos” is virtually meaningless, and free from the childish, anthropomorphic ideas of religion.

      It is a mistake to consider any belief more liberated than another. It is the possibility of change which is important. Every new form of liberation is destined to eventually become another form of enslavement for most of its adherents. There is no freedom from duality on this plane of existence, but one may at least aspire to choose duality.

      Liberating behavior is that which increases one's possibilities for future action. Limiting behavior is that which tends to narrow one's options. The secret of freedom is not to be drawn into situations where one's number of alternatives becomes limited or even unitary.

      In argument, always disagree, especially if your opponent begins to voice your own opinions.

      The only clear view is from atop the mountain of your dead selves.

      Those who self-righteously value their own contradictions are mighty on this earth.

      Science has brought us power and ideas but not the wisdom or responsibility to handle them.

      The chaotic aspect of new aeon magic is psychological anarchy. It is a species of operation mindfuck applied to ourselves as much as the world. The aim is to produce inspiration and enlightenment through disordering our belief structures. Humor, random belief, counter-information, and disinformation are its techniques.

      Life is its own answer, my spirituality is the way I live it.

      Baphomet is the psychic field generated by the totality of living beings on this planet.
